METHODS: Optic nerve head and peripapillary area images were taken using the 20° × 20°-scan of Spectralis OCTA (Heidelberg Engineering) in 97 subjects (64 POAG patients, 33 control patients). The optic nerve head microvasculature was evaluated according to predefined slabs: the superficial vascular complex (SVC) and the avascular complex (AVC). The en face image of each slab was processed by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) in order to calculate the vessel density and the fractal dimension using the box-counting method. For comparison, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was obtained from Spectralis OCT circle scans. The utilities of the parameters for discriminating between the POAG and control groups were assessed using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs).
RESULTS: The SVC fractal dimension was lower in the POAG than in the control group (p < 0.001), while AVC showed no intergroup difference (p = 0.563). The fractal dimension showed a good correlation with the vessel density in both SVC and AVC (both p < 0.001). In a multivariable regression analysis, the SVC fractal dimension was negatively correlated with age (p < 0.001) and axial length (p < 0.001) and positively correlated with average RNFL thickness (p < 0.001), while the AVC fractal dimension was positively correlated with the Bruch's membrane opening size (p = 0.013). In terms of diagnostic utility, the AUC was significantly larger for the average RNFL thickness (AUC, 0.889) than for the SVC fractal dimension (AUC, 0.772; p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: The fractal dimension of SVC was associated with the average RNFL thickness and was reduced in POAG patients.

For this, fractal theory, laser particle size analyzer, scanning electron microscope and other mesoscopic research methods were introduced. This study has several main factors, including the discharge port width in the jaw crushing stage, the grinding particle size, ball-to-powder ratio in the ball milling stage, and the fractal dimension changes of the gangue in different crushing stages. The results indicate that in the process of ""jaw crushing-ball milling"", gangue's particle size and shape fractal dimension values changed periodically. During the jaw crushing stage, the particle size fractal dimension increases with the width of the discharge opening, ranging from 1.85 to 1.92. The value of the shape fractal dimension varies from 2.65 to 2.84. Ball milling causes the fractal dimension value of gangue particle size to increase with time before agglomeration and decrease after agglomeration. By comparing different in-grinding particle sizes and ball-to-powder ratio, it is found that the fractal dimension value of gangue particle size decreases with the increase of in-grinding particle size and increases with the increase of ball-to-powder ratio. The final gangue's particle size fractal dimension value is concentrated between 2.5 and 2.8. The fractal dimension of particle shape increases with the increase of the grinding particle size, and decreases with the increase of ball-to-powder ratio. A ball-to-powder ratio greater than 6 gradually reduces its influence on fractal dimensions, and the final shape dimension lies between 1.06 and 1.16. In addition, the increase/decrease range of particle size and shape fractal dimension decreases with the increase of ball milling time, which is also consistent with the grinding kinetics theory. As a result of the changes in particle size and shape fractal dimensions, parameters such as jaw crusher discharge port width, grinding particle size, and ball-to-powder ratio are calculated to provide a theoretical basis for the entire crushing process in the ""jaw crusher-ball milling"" crushing process.",,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Miguel Angel Sánchez Granero,Fractals; Powders; Particle Size; Transtheoretical Model,2023-02-17,2023,2023-02-17,,18,2,e0281513,,,"Gu, Wenzhe; Zhu, Lei; Liu, Zhicheng; He, Zhiwei","Gu, Wenzhe (School of Energy and Mining Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China); Zhu, Lei (China Coal Energy Research Institute, Xi’ an, China); Liu, Zhicheng (China Coal Energy Research Institute, Xi’ an, China); He, Zhiwei (China Coal Energy Research Institute, Xi’ an, China)","Zhu, Lei (Energy Research Institute)","Gu, Wenzhe (China University of Mining and Technology); Zhu, Lei (Energy Research Institute); Liu, Zhicheng (Energy Research Institute); He, Zhiwei (Energy Research Institute)",1,1,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281513&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155484953,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

It is simple to learn and implement and has been extensively utilized. However, this approach has several problems, such as over- or undercounting the number of boxes due to inappropriate parameter choices, limiting the calculation accuracy. Many studies have been conducted to increase the algorithm's computational accuracy by improving the calculating parameters of the differential box-counting method. The grid size is a crucial parameter for the DBC method. Generally, there are two typical ways for selecting the grid size in relevant studies: consecutive integer and divisors of image size. However, both methods for grid size selection are problematic. The consecutive integer method cannot partition the image entirely and will result in the undercounting of boxes; the divisors of image size can partition the image completely. However, this method uses fewer grid sizes to compute fractal dimensions and has a relatively huge distance error (DE). To address the shortcomings of the above-mentioned two approaches, this research presents an improved grid size selection strategy. The improved method enhances computational accuracy by computing the discarded image edge areas in the consecutive integer method, allowing the original image information to be used as thoroughly as the divisor strategy. Based on fractional Brownian motion (FBM), Brodatz, and Aerials image sets, the accuracy of the three grid size selection techniques (consecutive integer method, divisors of image size method, and the improved algorithm) to compute the fractal dimension is then compared. The results reveal that, compared to the two prior techniques, the revised algorithm described in this study minimizes the distance error and increases the accuracy of the fractal dimension computation.",The authors would also like to acknowledge the receipt of a research grant award as principal investigators from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 51479030.,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51479030).,Entropy,,Gholamreza Anbarjafari,,2022-07-14,2022,2022-07-14,,24,7,977,,,"Jiang, Wenxuan; Liu, Yujun; Wang, Ji; Li, Rui; Liu, Xiao; Zhang, Jian","Jiang, Wenxuan (School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, jwx1991@126.com, (W.J.);, yjliu@dlut.edu.cn, (Y.L.);, lirui@dlut.edu.cn, (R.L.);, liuxiao@dlut.edu.cn, (X.L.)); Liu, Yujun (School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, jwx1991@126.com, (W.J.);, yjliu@dlut.edu.cn, (Y.L.);, lirui@dlut.edu.cn, (R.L.);, liuxiao@dlut.edu.cn, (X.L.)); Wang, Ji (School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, jwx1991@126.com, (W.J.);, yjliu@dlut.edu.cn, (Y.L.);, lirui@dlut.edu.cn, (R.L.);, liuxiao@dlut.edu.cn, (X.L.); Collaborative Innovation Centre for Advanced Ship and Deep-Sea Exploration, Shanghai Jiaotong University, No. 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai 200240, China; State Key Laboratory of Structural Analysis for Industrial Equipment, Dalian 116024, China); Li, Rui (School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, jwx1991@126.com, (W.J.);, yjliu@dlut.edu.cn, (Y.L.);, lirui@dlut.edu.cn, (R.L.);, liuxiao@dlut.edu.cn, (X.L.)); Liu, Xiao (School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, jwx1991@126.com, (W.J.);, yjliu@dlut.edu.cn, (Y.L.);, lirui@dlut.edu.cn, (R.L.);, liuxiao@dlut.edu.cn, (X.L.)); Zhang, Jian (School of Foreign Languages, Dalian University of Technolog, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, janezh@dlut.edu.cn)","Wang, Ji (Dalian University of Technology; School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, jwx1991@126.com, (W.J.);, yjliu@dlut.edu.cn, (Y.L.);, lirui@dlut.edu.cn, (R.L.);, liuxiao@dlut.edu.cn, (X.L.); Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Dalian University of Technology)","Jiang, Wenxuan (Dalian University of Technology; School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, jwx1991@126.com, (W.J.);, yjliu@dlut.edu.cn, (Y.L.);, lirui@dlut.edu.cn, (R.L.);, liuxiao@dlut.edu.cn, (X.L.)); Liu, Yujun (Dalian University of Technology; School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, jwx1991@126.com, (W.J.);, yjliu@dlut.edu.cn, (Y.L.);, lirui@dlut.edu.cn, (R.L.);, liuxiao@dlut.edu.cn, (X.L.)); Wang, Ji (Dalian University of Technology; School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, jwx1991@126.com, (W.J.);, yjliu@dlut.edu.cn, (Y.L.);, lirui@dlut.edu.cn, (R.L.);, liuxiao@dlut.edu.cn, (X.L.); Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Dalian University of Technology); Li, Rui (Dalian University of Technology; School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, jwx1991@126.com, (W.J.);, yjliu@dlut.edu.cn, (Y.L.);, lirui@dlut.edu.cn, (R.L.);, liuxiao@dlut.edu.cn, (X.L.)); Liu, Xiao (Dalian University of Technology; School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, No. 2 Linggong Road, Ganjingzi District, Dalian 116024, China;, jwx1991@126.com, (W.J.);, yjliu@dlut.edu.cn, (Y.L.);, lirui@dlut.edu.cn, (R.L.);, liuxiao@dlut.edu.cn, (X.L.)); Zhang, Jian (Dalian University)",1,1,0.43,,https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/7/977/pdf?version=1657861333,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149517128,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,

Organic geochemical data show that the thermal simulation hydrocarbon generation threshold is between 300 and 400 °C. According to AIP-SEM observation, the pore types of the samples are different in different thermal simulation stages. The fractal dimensions are calculated by low-temperature N2 adsorption data using the fractal Frenkel-Halsey-Hill fractal model. The average surface fractal dimension (D 1) is 2.26, indicating that the pore (<4 nm) surface is relatively smooth. The average pore structure fractal dimension (D 2) is 2.49, indicating that the pore (>4 nm) structure is complex. Through the exploration of the relationship between fractal dimensions and organic geochemistry, whole rock X-ray diffraction, and N2 adsorption data, it is found that fractal dimensions have different degrees of correlation with thermal maturity, mineral composition, TOC content, and pore parameters. Through comprehensive research, it shows that hydrocarbon generation and expulsion, oil and gas cracking, and organic matter carbonization have important effects on the pore structure and fractal characteristics of oil shale.",Support was provided by the key research and development projects of Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department (Grant No. 20180201077SF).,,ACS Omega,,,,2022-04-09,2022,2022-04-09,2022-04-19,7,15,12922-12936,,,"Liu, Gaofei; Liu, Rong; Du, Jiangfeng; Zhang, Kun; Yu, Jiaqi; Liu, Qianghao; He, Xiangwu","Liu, Gaofei (College of Earth Sciences, Jilin University, 130061, Changchun, China; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China); Liu, Rong (College of Earth Sciences, Jilin University, 130061, Changchun, China; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China; Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory for Evolution of Past Life and Environment in Northeast Asia (Jilin University), 130026, Changchun, China); Du, Jiangfeng (CNOOC Research Institute Co., Ltd., 100028, Beijing, China); Zhang, Kun (College of Earth Sciences, Jilin University, 130061, Changchun, China; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China); Yu, Jiaqi (College of Earth Sciences, Jilin University, 130061, Changchun, China; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China); Liu, Qianghao (College of Earth Sciences, Jilin University, 130061, Changchun, China; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China); He, Xiangwu (College of Earth Sciences, Jilin University, 130061, Changchun, China; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China)","Liu, Rong (Jilin University; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China; Jilin University)","Liu, Gaofei (Jilin University; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China); Liu, Rong (Jilin University; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China; Jilin University); Du, Jiangfeng (China National Offshore Oil Corporation (China)); Zhang, Kun (Jilin University; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China); Yu, Jiaqi (Jilin University; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China); Liu, Qianghao (Jilin University; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China); He, Xiangwu (Jilin University; Key Laboratory of Oil Shale and Coexistent Energy Minerals of Jilin Province, 130061, Changchun, China)",7,7,,1.9,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.2c00227,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146971055,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Given that incidence curves exhibit considerable day-to-day variation, the fractal structure of the time series dynamics is investigated for the Flanders and Brussels Regions of Belgium. For each statistical sector, the smallest administrative geographical entity in Belgium, fractal dimensions of COVID-19 incidence rates, based on rolling time spans of 7, 14, and 21 days were estimated using four different estimators: box-count, Hall-Wood, variogram, and madogram. We found varying patterns of fractal dimensions across time and location. The fractal dimension is further summarized by its mean, variance, and autocorrelation over time. These summary statistics are then used to cluster regions with different incidence rate patterns using k-means clustering. Fractal dimension analysis of COVID-19 incidence thus offers important insight into the past, current, and arguably future evolution of an infectious disease outbreak.","The authors thank Myriam Uytterhoeven, Nikolaï Vanstaen, and Katrien Tersago for providing daily COVID-19 confirmed cases data and critical reading of the original version of the paper.

The results show that the volume of pores and fractures of the coal sample (C200) treated at 200 °C (0.1715 mL/g) is greater than that of the coal sample (C400) treated at 400 °C (0.1209 mL/g), and both are greater than the original coal sample (RC) (0.1135 mL/g). The volume increase is mainly due to mesopores and macropores, and the proportions of mesopores and macropores in C200 were 70.15 and 59.97% in C400. The MIP fractal dimension shows a decreasing trend with the increase of temperature, and the connectivity of coal samples improved with the increase of temperature. The changes in volume and three-dimensional fractal dimension of C200 and C400 showed the opposite trend and are related to the different stress of coal matrix at different temperatures. The experimental SEM images confirm that the connectivity of coal fractures and pores improves with the increase of temperature. Based on the SEM experiment, the larger the fractal dimension, the more complex the surface is. The SEM surface fractal dimensions indicate that the surface fractal dimension of C200 is the smallest and that of C400 is the largest, which is consistent with the observations made by SEM. The combination of the two fractal dimensions is used to characterize the self-similarity of coal using the fractal dimension difference. When the temperature increased to 200 °C, the unordered expansion of the coal sample resulted in the largest fractal dimension difference and the lowest self-similarity. When heated to 400 °C, the fractal dimension difference of the coal sample is the smallest, and the microstructure of coal shows a regular groove-like development.","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the research funding provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52074108 and 52274189), the Henan Science and Technology Research Project (No. 212102310007), the Science and Technology Innovation Talent Support Program of Henan University (No. 22HASTIT012), the Key Scientific Research Projects of Henan Colleges and Universities (No. 22A620001), and the World first-class universities and world first-class disciplines founding project of Henan Polytechnic University (Nos.

To reveal the changes in pore complexity, mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP), low-pressure nitrogen adsorption, CO2 adsorption, and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) experiments were combined with fractal theory. The experimental data of MICP show that the MICP data are meaningful only for the pore fractal dimension with pore sizes >150 nm. Therefore, the pores were classified into the classes >150, 2-150, and <2 nm. The results show that the pore volume and specific surface area of the coal increased significantly after the reaction. ScCO2-H2O can cause the formation of many new pores and fractures in the coal. The presence of H2O may increase the potential for the injection of CO2 into the coal seam. The complete dissolution of calcite surfaces caused a significant increase in the pore volume and specific surface area of the pores >150 nm. The morphologies of these pores are controlled by the morphologies of the complete dissolution carbonate particles. The pore morphologies were relatively uniform, and the fractal dimensions decreased. However, the incomplete dissolution of calcite leads to irregular variations in the morphologies for the pores in the 2-150 nm pore size range. The pore morphologies that are produced by incompletely dissolved calcite particles are more complex, which increases the fractal dimensions after the reaction. The fractal dimensions of the pores <2 nm decreased after the reaction, indicating that the newly generated micropores were more uniform and had regular pore morphologies.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41902168), the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education (20JK0761), the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (2021JQ-560), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.42102224, 42102217), Shaanxi Natural Science Foundation (2021JCW-04), and the Young Talent Fund of University Association for Science and Technology in Shaanxi, China (No. 20210703).",,ACS Omega,,,,2023-05-19,2023,2023-05-19,,8,21,18964-18980,,,"Ma, Xicong; Du, Yi; Fu, Changqing; Fang, Huihuang; Wei, Haonan; Pan, Zhejun; Sang, Shuxun; Zhang, Junying","Ma, Xicong (National and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Carbon Capture Utilization and Sequestration & State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics, Department of Geology, Northwest University, Xi’an, 710069, China); Du, Yi (National and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Carbon Capture Utilization and Sequestration & State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics, Department of Geology, Northwest University, Xi’an, 710069, China; State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion, School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China); Fu, Changqing (College of Geology and Environment, Xi’an University of Science & Technology, Xi’an, 710054, China); Fang, Huihuang (School of Earth and Environment, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, Anhui, 232001, China); Wei, Haonan (National and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Carbon Capture Utilization and Sequestration & State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics, Department of Geology, Northwest University, Xi’an, 710069, China); Pan, Zhejun (Key Laboratory of Continental Shale Hydrocarbon Accumulation and Efficient Development, Ministry of Education, Northeast Petroleum University, Daqing, 163318, China); Sang, Shuxun (Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Coal-based Greenhouse Gas Control and Utilization, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, 221008, China); Zhang, Junying (State Key Laboratory of Coal Combustion, School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China)","Du, Yi (Northwest University; Huazhong University of Science and Technology)","Ma, Xicong (Northwest University); Du, Yi (Northwest University; Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Fu, Changqing (Xi'an University of Science and Technology); Fang, Huihuang (Anhui University of Science and Technology); Wei, Haonan (Northwest University); Pan, Zhejun (Northeast Petroleum University); Sang, Shuxun (China University of Mining and Technology); Zhang, Junying (Huazhong University of Science and Technology)",2,2,,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.3c01486,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158198620,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

The surface roughness characteristics of the fuel nozzle directly affect the degree of fuel atomization and the spray cone angle. The surface characterization of the fuel nozzle is investigated by the fractal analysis method. A sequence of images of an unheated treatment fuel nozzle and a heated treatment fuel nozzle are captured by the super-depth digital camera. The 3-D point cloud of the fuel nozzle is acquired by the shape from focus technique, and its three-dimensional (3-D) fractal dimensions are calculated and analyzed by the 3-D sandbox counting method. The proposed method can characterize the surface morphology well, including the standard metal processing surface and the fuel nozzle surface, and the experiments show that the 3-D surface fractal dimension is positively correlated with the surface roughness parameter. The 3-D surface fractal dimensions of the unheated treatment fuel nozzle were 2.6281, 2.8697, and 2.7620, compared with the heated treatment fuel nozzles dimensions of 2.3021, 2.5322, and 2.3327. Thus, the 3-D surface fractal dimension value of the unheated treatment is larger than that of the heated treatment and is sensitive to surface defects. This study indicates that the 3-D sandbox counting fractal dimension method is an effective method to evaluate the fuel nozzle surface and other metal processing surfaces.",,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 51905461 and No. 51975495).

Histopathology continues to be the gold standard, assessing specific parameters such as the Breslow index. However, it remains invasive and may lack effectiveness. Therefore, leveraging mathematical modeling and informatics has been a pursuit of diagnostic methods favoring early detection. Fractality, a mathematical parameter quantifying complexity and irregularity, has proven useful in melanoma diagnosis. Nonetheless, no studies have implemented this metric to feed artificial intelligence algorithms for the automatic classification of dermatological lesions, including melanoma. Hence, this study aimed to determine the combined utility of fractal dimension and unsupervised low-computational-requirements machine learning models in classifying melanoma and non-melanoma lesions. We analyzed 39,270 dermatological lesions obtained from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration. Box-counting fractal dimensions were calculated for these lesions. Fractal values were used to implement classification methods by unsupervised machine learning based on principal component analysis and iterated K-means (100 iterations). A clear separation was observed, using only fractal dimension values, between benign or malignant lesions (sensibility 72.4% and specificity 50.1%) and melanoma or non-melanoma lesions (sensibility 72.8% and specificity 50%) and subsequently, the classification quality based on the machine learning model was ≈80% for both benign and malignant or melanoma and non-melanoma lesions. However, the grouping of metastatic melanoma versus non-metastatic melanoma was less effective, probably due to the small sample size included in MM lesions. Nevertheless, we could suggest a decision algorithm based on fractal dimension for dermatological lesion discrimination. On the other hand, it was also determined that the fractal dimension is sufficient to generate unsupervised artificial intelligence models that allow for a more efficient classification of dermatological lesions.",We acknowledge to Miriam Luna Hernández for the technical and personal support; to Roberto Gaytan and Roberto de los Ríos for software develop suggestions and José Luis Hernández Olvera and Adaia Rodríguez Solorio for administrative support.,"This research was funded by CONAHCyT, PRM was scholarship receipt of the Program: Complementary Support for Sabbatical Stays Linked to the Consolidation of Research Groups, scholarship number 2022-000013-01NACV-00108; and the APC was funded by Universidad Estatal del Valle de Ecatepec.",Diagnostics,,Sameer Antani,,2024-05-29,2024,2024-05-29,,14,11,1132,,,"Romero-Morelos, Pablo; Herrera-López, Elizabeth; González-Yebra, Beatriz","Romero-Morelos, Pablo (Department of Research, State University of the Valley of Ecatepec, Ecatepec 55210, México State, Mexico;, pablo.r.morelos@gmail.com, (P.R.-M.);, eliza_herrera83@yahoo.com.mx, (E.H.-L.); National Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, CONAHCyT (LNC-IACD), Ecatepec 55210, México State, Mexico); Herrera-López, Elizabeth (Department of Research, State University of the Valley of Ecatepec, Ecatepec 55210, México State, Mexico;, pablo.r.morelos@gmail.com, (P.R.-M.);, eliza_herrera83@yahoo.com.mx, (E.H.-L.); National Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, CONAHCyT (LNC-IACD), Ecatepec 55210, México State, Mexico); González-Yebra, Beatriz (Department of Medicine and Nutrition, Division of Health Sciences, University of Guanajuato, Campus León, León 37670, Guanajuato, Mexico)","González-Yebra, Beatriz (Universidad de Guanajuato)","Romero-Morelos, Pablo (Department of Research, State University of the Valley of Ecatepec, Ecatepec 55210, México State, Mexico;, pablo.r.morelos@gmail.com, (P.R.-M.);, eliza_herrera83@yahoo.com.mx, (E.H.-L.); National Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, CONAHCyT (LNC-IACD), Ecatepec 55210, México State, Mexico); Herrera-López, Elizabeth (Department of Research, State University of the Valley of Ecatepec, Ecatepec 55210, México State, Mexico;, pablo.r.morelos@gmail.com, (P.R.-M.);, eliza_herrera83@yahoo.com.mx, (E.H.-L.); National Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, CONAHCyT (LNC-IACD), Ecatepec 55210, México State, Mexico); González-Yebra, Beatriz (Universidad de Guanajuato)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/14/11/1132/pdf?version=1716987768,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172287242,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Based on vitrinite reflectance, coal maceral, proximate analysis, low-temperature N2 adsorption, and methane isothermal adsorption experiments, the heterogeneities of adsorption pores (pore diameter <100 nm) were quantitatively characterized, and relationships between fractal dimensions and physical parameters of low-ranked coal reservoirs were revealed. The results show that the micropore volume percentage ranges between 33.70 and 86.44% with an average of 64.94%. Based on N2 adsorption/desorption curves and pore diameter distribution characteristics, the adsorption pore structures of low-ranked coals were divided into 3 types. According to the FHH model, fractal dimension D1 (relative pressure between 0 and 0.5) and D2 (relative pressure between 0.5 and 1) were calculated. Fractal dimension D1, representing adsorption pore surface area, ranges from 2.001 to 2.345, with lower values. Fractal dimension D2 (adsorption pore structure) is from 2.641 to 2.917, with relatively high values, which has a decreasing tendency from west to east in the study area. There are positive relationships between fractal dimension D1 and Langmuir volume and specific surface area, whereas negative correlations are found between fractal dimension D2 and Langmuir pressure, ash yield, moisture content, volatile content, and average pore diameter. Combined with the related data for middle- and high-rank coals, the characteristics of pore surface and methane adsorption capacity can be analyzed based on the variation of vitrinite reflectance. Furthermore, the complexity of pore structure can also be predicted according to the averaged pore size and micropore content to some degree.","The coal sample collection received was great assistance from Baoming Guo from Lvcaogou coal mine and Lei Liu and Xuetian Wang from China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing).

In order to explore the effect of rapid pyrolysis process on SO2 adsorption capacity of PAC, the fractal analysis of PAC prepared under different atmospheres was carried out. The Frenkel–Halsey–Hill (FHH) method was used to determine two fractal dimensions D1 and D2, under relative pressures of 0–0.5 and 0.5–1, respectively. The results indicate that the fractal dimensions were influenced by the concentrations of activation agents with D1 ranging from 2.1838 to 2.8643 and D2 ranging from 2.7485 to 2.9257. The effect of steam on the fractal dimension of PAC sample is small, but oxygen has a great promotion effect on the fractal dimension. An n-shaped curve-based relationship between fractal dimensions and coke yields is observed with a peak values of fractal dimensions appearing around 64% yield. The SO2 adsorption capacity shows a consecutively positive linear correlation with D2, while it illustrates distinctly different linear rates with D1 in intervals of 2–2.6 and 2.6–3, respectively. Taking advantage of fractal analysis as research method, this paper clarified the influence of activation atmosphere and ablative degree on the SO2 adsorption capacity of PAC, and the research conclusion provided a basis for the PAC preparation with high SO2 capacity.","We thank Jiangwei Xue, Longzhi Li, Peiyi Liu, and Shanchuan Li for helping with the experiment.",This research is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2019BEE063).,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,,2022-07-18,2022,2022-07-18,2022-12,29,59,89210-89220,,,"Feng, Tai; Kong, Qiwen; Xue, Jiangwei; Li, Longzhi; Liu, Peiyi; Li, Shanchuan; Zhang, Zhen","Feng, Tai (College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, People’s Republic of China); Kong, Qiwen (College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, People’s Republic of China); Xue, Jiangwei (College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, People’s Republic of China); Li, Longzhi (College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, People’s Republic of China); Liu, Peiyi (College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, People’s Republic of China); Li, Shanchuan (College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, People’s Republic of China); Zhang, Zhen (College of Electric Power, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, 450045, Zhengzhou, People’s Republic of China)","Feng, Tai (Shandong University of Science and Technology)","Feng, Tai (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Kong, Qiwen (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Xue, Jiangwei (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Li, Longzhi (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Liu, Peiyi (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Li, Shanchuan (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Zhang, Zhen (North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power)",1,1,,0.25,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1599284/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149548127,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

The effects of WCR and SCR on different porosity parameters and mechanical properties were discussed. The correlation and internal relationship between mechanical properties and parameters of different porosities and fractal dimensions were analyzed. Experimental results showed that the different porosity parameters and fractal dimensions increased with the increase in WCR. 1.0 (SCR) was the turning point of different porosity parameters and fractal dimensions. When the SCR was less than 1.0, the porosity parameters and fractal dimension gradually decreased, while when the SCR was greater than 1.0, the porosity parameters and fractal dimension gradually increased. Microscopic porosity parameters and fractal dimension played an important role in the influence of experimental factors on mechanical properties. Different porosity parameters and fractal dimensions were negatively correlated with mechanical properties.

Participants (n = 40) were asked to walk towards different types of synthetic images which were parametrically varied in their fractal dimensions.

Benign and dysplastic nevi and melanomas may have similar clinical presentations, but completely different prognoses. Fractal dimensions of shape and texture can describe the complexity of the pigmented lesion structure. This study aims to apply fractal dimension analysis to differentiate melanomas, dysplastic nevi, and benign nevi in polarized and non-polarized light. A total of 87 Eighty-four patients with 97 lesions were included in this study. All examined lesions were photographed under polarized and non-polarized light, surgically removed, and examined by a histopathologist to establish the correct diagnosis. The obtained images were then processed and analyzed. Area, perimeter, and fractal dimensions of shape and texture were calculated for all the lesions under polarized and non-polarized light. The fractal dimension of shape in polarized light enables differentiating melanomas, dysplastic nevi, and benign nevi. It also makes it possible to distinguish melanomas from benign and dysplastic nevi under non-polarized light. The fractal dimension of texture allows distinguishing melanomas from benign and dysplastic nevi under polarized light. All examined parameters of shape and texture can be used for developing an automatic computer-aided diagnosis system. Polarized light is superior to non-polarized light for imaging texture details.",,"This research was funded by the Medical University of Lodz.

In this study, we used the scanning electron microscope and image processing method to investigate the relationship between the complicity of cement microstructure and compressive strength under various temperatures and curing times. Fractal dimension was applied to describe the complicity of silica-enhanced cement. The relationships among compressive strength, fractal dimension, temperature, curing time and pore structure of cement were identified. The results show that curing time directly controls the complicity of microstructure of silica-enhanced cement and compressive strength by altering the pore orientation and macropore ratio in silica-enhanced cement. The curing temperature affects the complicity of cement microstructure and compressive strength indirectly by changing the ratio of micropore and small pore. The fractal dimension of silica-enhanced cement shows good correlation with compressive strength. Pore size distribution is the most important factor that influences the complicity of cement matrix and compressive strength of silica-enhanced cement. When building up the macroscopic mechanical performance model of silica-enhanced cement, we should consider the influence of pore size distribution in cement under different curing temperatures and times on the complicity of cement microstructure.",,This research was funded by Shandong Social Science Planning Research Project (grant no. 21DWYJ20).,Royal Society Open Science,,,,2022-08-10,2022,2022-08-10,2022-08,9,8,220150,,,"Chen, Zhonggao; Du, Jiapei; Zhou, Annan; Wang, Chunyu; Bu, Yuhuan; Liu, Huajie","Chen, Zhonggao (School of Architecture, Yantai University, Yantai, Shandong 264005, People's Republic of China); Du, Jiapei (School of Engineering, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Melbourne, Victoria 3001, Australia); Zhou, Annan (School of Engineering, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Melbourne, Victoria 3001, Australia); Wang, Chunyu (College of Material Science and Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing 211816, People's Republic of China); Bu, Yuhuan (College of Petroleum Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao, Shandong 266580, Australia); Liu, Huajie (College of Petroleum Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao, Shandong 266580, Australia)","Du, Jiapei (RMIT University); Wang, Chunyu (Nanjing Tech University)","Chen, Zhonggao (Yantai University); Du, Jiapei (RMIT University); Zhou, Annan (RMIT University); Wang, Chunyu (Nanjing Tech University); Bu, Yuhuan (China University of Petroleum, East China); Liu, Huajie (China University of Petroleum, East China)",1,1,0.74,0.54,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.220150,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150120455,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

The PE-ECCs were prepared with four fine aggregates, respectively. Furthermore, their flowability, compressive strength, and uniaxial tensile properties were studied experimentally and comparatively analyzed by microscopic techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The results showed that all the different types of fine aggregates exhibited little effect on the flowability of PE-ECC, but a greater effect on the compressive strength, uniaxial tensile strength, and ultimate tensile strain. PE-ECC prepared from untreated desert sand showed the best comprehensive performance, with compressive strength, uniaxial tensile strength, and ultimate tensile strain of 47.92 MPa, 6.26 MPa, and 3.638%, respectively. Moreover, it was found that the ultra-fine particles in the desert sand promoted the hydration reaction of cement and produced more C-S-H gels. The pore structures of ECC prepared with different aggregates exhibited obvious fractal characteristics, and the fractal dimension ranged from 2.8 to 2.9.

To research the distribution and evolution of the overburden fissures and quantitatively analyze them have certain theoretical and engineering significance for realizing the evaluation of overburden damage degree and safe and green mining. This paper takes the 6102 working face of Chuancao Gedan Coal Mine as the engineering background. The development law and distribution characteristics of overburden fissures caused by the mining of shallow coal seams in the loess gully area were studied by the combination of physical similarity simulation, numerical similarity simulation and fractal theory. The results show that the fractal dimension change of the overburden fissures caused by the shallow mining of coal seam groups in the loess gully area can be divided into three stages during the mining process of the working face. Repeated mining causes the activation and development of overburden fissures, the fractal dimension increases significantly, and the regularity of changes weakens. The magnitude of the stress near the working face and the fluctuation times of the stress in the goaf have an influence on the change of the fractal dimension of the overburden fissures. According to the development angle and the fractal dimension of the overburden fissures, the overburden rock above the goaf is divided into the collapse fissure area, the compaction fissure area, and the vertical fissure area. Overburden fissures develop violently in the vertical fissure area, the overburden fissures in the compaction fissure area are mostly transverse fissures, and the overburden fissures in the caving fissure area are irregular.",We thank the academic editors and anonymous reviewers for their kind suggestions and valuable comments.,"Thanks to the National Natural Science Foundation of China(, grant number 51864036), the Program for Young Talents of Science and Technology in Universities of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant number NJYT-19-B33), and the Program for young innovative talents of “Grassland Talents” of Inner Mongolia for providing financial support to the author Jianwei Li.

The frequencies of such oscillations are dynamically changing while clusters of weakly coupled mitochondrial oscillators adjust to a common phase and frequency. Across the cardiac myocyte, the averaged signal of the mitochondrial population follows self-similar or fractal dynamics; however, fractal properties of individual mitochondrial oscillators have not yet been examined. We show that the largest synchronously oscillating cluster exhibits a fractal dimension, D, that is indicative of self-similar behavior with D=1.27±0.11, in contrast to the remaining network mitochondria whose fractal dimension is close to that of Brownian noise, D=1.58±0.10. We further demonstrate that fractal behavior is correlated with local coupling mechanisms, whereas it is only weakly linked to measures of functional connections between mitochondria. Our findings suggest that individual mitochondrial fractal dimensions may serve as a simple measure of local mitochondrial coupling.","Acknowledgments The work was supported by the Ricbac Foundation, NIH grants 1 R01 HL135335-01, R01 HL161008-01, 1 R21 HL137870-01, and 1 R21EB026164-01 (to A.A.A.) and R01HL137259 (to B.O’R.).

Controversial results were reported by various studies; however, the nature of scale dependency and the underlying mechanism for the conflicting observations remain unclear. Rock joints at different scales characterise two-order asperities, namely, waviness and unevenness; thus understanding how the individual roughness of waviness and unevenness vary as the joint size increases from the laboratory-scale to the large-scale is crucial for revealing the scale effect mystery. Here we digitise three natural granite joint surfaces with the same dimension of 1000 mm × 1000 mm through a high-resolution, three-dimensional scanner. Waviness and unevenness of each rock joint surface are quantitatively separated by selecting an appropriate sampling interval. The respective fractal dimensions of waviness and unevenness of joint surfaces sized from 100 mm × 100 mm to 1000 mm × 1000 mm are estimated through an improved roughness-length method. We find that the fractal dimensions of two-order roughness are scale-dependent but without generalised trends. The stationarity threshold beyond which the scale-dependency of roughness vanishes is absent for all the three joint samples, suggesting that the roughness of natural rock joints be assessed at the specific scale of the rock mass in-situ. We reveal that previous controversial results regarding scale effect are likely due to the composition of the roughness scaling of waviness and unevenness. Thus, accurate stability analysis of rock-engineering projects should consider separate contributions of multi-order asperities across scales to the strength and deformation of jointed rock masses.","Yingchun Li thanks the financial supports from the National Key Research and Development Plan (Grant No. 2018YFC1505301) and the National Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 51809033).

Fifteen electrospun membrane samples of PMMA and PMMA/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) materials were prepared under similar concentrations and voltage parameters, and 525 SEM images of the surface morphology with a resolution of 2560 × 1920 were taken as a dataset. The feature parameters, such as fiber diameter and direction, are extracted from the image. Second, based on the minimum value of the power law behavior, the pore perimeter data were preprocessed to calculate the fractal dimensions. A 2D model was reconstructed randomly based on the inverse transformation of the characteristic parameters. The genetic optimization algorithm adjusts the fiber arrangement to realize the control of characteristic parameters, such as the fractal dimension. Based on the 2D model, a long fiber network layer with a thickness consistent with the depth of the SEM shooting is generated in ABAQUS software. Finally, a solid CAD model of the electrospun membrane with realistic thickness was constructed by combining multiple fiber layers. The result shows that the improved fractal dimension exhibits multifractal characteristics and distinct sample differences, which are more similar to the experimental results.

Understanding the particle size composition characteristics of rock weathering debris and its impacts is important for improving the soil structure of dry farmland in the central dry zone of Ningxia,China. In this study, the particle sizes of weathered debris collected from grey–green slate after indoor simulations of freeze–thaw and dry–wet cycles tests were examined. The results were as follows: (1) Under 16 treatments, the weathering debris of grey–green slate contained about 10% or less very fine sand and coarse silt, while clay, fine silt, and fine sand were the most abundant sizes (at least 60% of the total). (2) Under each treatment, the average particle size of the grey–green slate weathered debris was 5.52Ф (silt grade). The overall skewness was high, but the symmetry was poor. The particle size frequency distribution curve had many broad peaks or multiple peaks. (3) The fractal dimension was associated with very fine silt but had a strong negative correlation with fine sand and medium-coarse sand. The results indicate that fractal dimension can reflect the grain size characteristics of weathered debris. The mineral element content of the grey–green slate somewhat affected the fractal dimension, and it positively correlated with environmental electrical conductivity (EC) and element-leaching amount; it negatively correlated with particle size, temperature, and pH. According to the findings, the fractal dimension can accurately represent the particle size distribution of weathered debris. The generation of grey–green slate weathering debris should be considered in the formation and development of local soil.",,"The funding was provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 52169010, 51869023), The Key Project of Ningxia Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 2021AAC02008), Ningxia Key Research and Development Program (Grant No. 2019BEB04029).",Scientific Reports,,,,2023-01-25,2023,2023-01-25,,13,1,1421,,,"Wang, Jie; Li, Wangcheng; Mu, Min; Chen, Jihong; Li, Yangyang; Liu, Huaru; Su, Qikun","Wang, Jie (Country School of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, Ningxia University, 750021, Yinchuan, China); Li, Wangcheng (Country School of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, Ningxia University, 750021, Yinchuan, China; Engineering Research Center of Efficient Utilization of Modern Agricultural Water Resources in Arid Regions, Ministry of Education, 750021, Yinchuan, China; State Key Laboratory of Land Degradation and Ecological Restoration in Northwest China, 750021, Yinchuan, China); Mu, Min (Country School of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, Ningxia University, 750021, Yinchuan, China); Chen, Jihong (Country School of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, Ningxia University, 750021, Yinchuan, China); Li, Yangyang (Country School of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, Ningxia University, 750021, Yinchuan, China); Liu, Huaru (Country School of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, Ningxia University, 750021, Yinchuan, China); Su, Qikun (Country School of Civil and Hydraulic Engineering, Ningxia University, 750021, Yinchuan, China)","Li, Wangcheng (Ningxia University; Engineering Research Center of Efficient Utilization of Modern Agricultural Water Resources in Arid Regions, Ministry of Education, 750021, Yinchuan, China; State Key Laboratory of Land Degradation and Ecological Restoration in Northwest China, 750021, Yinchuan, China)","Wang, Jie (Ningxia University); Li, Wangcheng (Ningxia University; Engineering Research Center of Efficient Utilization of Modern Agricultural Water Resources in Arid Regions, Ministry of Education, 750021, Yinchuan, China; State Key Laboratory of Land Degradation and Ecological Restoration in Northwest China, 750021, Yinchuan, China); Mu, Min (Ningxia University); Chen, Jihong (Ningxia University); Li, Yangyang (Ningxia University); Liu, Huaru (Ningxia University); Su, Qikun (Ningxia University)",2,2,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27888-7.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154830770,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4106 Soil Sciences,

These changes can be visualized using techniques such as phase contrast microscopy, detected by light scattering, or analyzed numerically using quantitative phase imaging. The statistical variations of refractive index at the nanoscale can be quantified using disorder strength, a metric seen to increase with neoplastic change. In contrast, the spatial organization of these variations is typically characterized using a fractal dimension, which is also seen to increase with cancer progression. Here, we seek to link these two measurements using multiscale measurements of optical phase to calculate disorder strength and in turn to determine the fractal dimension of the structures. First, quantitative phase images are analyzed to show that the disorder strength metric changes with resolution. The trend of disorder strength with length scales is analyzed to determine the fractal dimension of the cellular structures. Comparison of these metrics is presented for different cell lines with varying phenotypes including MCF10A, MCF7, BT474, HT-29, A431, and A549 cell lines, in addition to three cell populations with modified phenotypes. Our results show that disorder strength and fractal dimension can both be obtained with quantitative phase imaging and that these metrics can independently distinguish between different cell lines. Furthermore, their combined use presents a new approach for better understanding cellular restructuring during different pathways.","Acknowledgments We acknowledge experimental support from Robert Highland III.

The transition behavior of CO2 hydrates in porous media is of great practical significance. In this work, CO2 hydrate formation/dissociation in porous media was monitored in real time by a low-field magnetic resonance (MR) system, and a series of dynamic fractal dimensions of the pore space occupied by converted water during the hydrate formation/dissociation process were obtained based on the transverse relaxation time (T2) distributions. In general, the dimension of the converted water space increases with hydrate formation and decreases with the hydrate dissociation progress. A smaller particle size of porous media and a lower initial water saturation can promote hydrate formation, and the corresponding fractal dimension is higher during the hydrate formation process. There is a special status of the fractal period observed during the hydrate formation/dissociation process, and it is considered the temporally and spatially uniform distribution of hydrate crystal formation/dissociation inside the porous media. These results also indicate the relationships between the hydrate transition progress and the dynamic fractal dimension, which are useful for future works on pore-scale hydrate-bearing transitions during hydrate-based CO2 sequestration.","The authors are grateful for the financial supporting of National Natural Science Foundation of China (52076030, 51676025 and 52076032), National Key Research and Development Plan of China (2019YFC0312304), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (DUT19TD29) and Opening Fund of MOE Key Laboratory of Ocean Energy Utilization and Energy Conservation (LOEC-202204).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Carbon Dioxide; Sand; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Water,2022-11-19,2022,2022-11-19,2023-02,859,Pt 2,160326,,,"Zhao, Yuechao; Li, Ming; Dong, Shuang; Zheng, Jia-Nan; Lei, Xu; Chen, Cong; Song, Yongchen","Zhao, Yuechao (Key Laboratory of Ocean Energy Utilization and Energy Conservation of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology, China.); Li, Ming (Chemical Engineering Department, University of Western Australia, Australia.); Dong, Shuang (Key Laboratory of Ocean Energy Utilization and Energy Conservation of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology, China.); Zheng, Jia-Nan (Shanghai Institute for Advanced Study, Zhejiang University, China.

It is sometimes claimed that these symptoms are a manifestation of a disrupted autonomic nervous system. Prior works studying this claim from the complex adaptive systems perspective, have observed a lower average complexity of physical activity patterns in chronic fatigue syndrome patients compared to healthy controls. To further study the robustness of such methods, we investigate the within-patient changes in complexity of activity over time. Furthermore, we explore how these changes might be related to changes in patient functioning.MethodsWe propose an extension of the allometric aggregation method, which characterises the complexity of a physiological signal by quantifying the evolution of its fractal dimension. We use it to investigate the temporal variations in within-patient complexity. To this end, physical activity patterns of 7 patients diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome were recorded over a period of 3 weeks. These recordings are accompanied by physicians’ judgements in terms of the patients’ weekly functioning.ResultsWe report significant within-patient variations in complexity over time. The obtained metrics are shown to depend on the range of timescales for which these are evaluated. We were unable to establish a consistent link between complexity and functioning on a week-by-week basis for the majority of the patients.ConclusionsThe considerable within-patient variations of the fractal dimension across scales and time force us to question the utility of previous studies that characterise long-term activity signals using a single static complexity metric. The complexity of a Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patient’s physical activity signal does not suffice to characterise their high-level functioning over time and has limited potential as an objective monitoring metric by itself.","We would like to thank general-practitioners-in-training Alexander Claeys Boúúaert, Janos Lacante, Winnie Pille and Carine Vanneste for the weekly follow-up of participants included in the trial, as well as their valuable input for interpreting the results.

Traditional fractal research often focuses on the urban spatial layout, which cannot visually express the specific form, change characteristics and development trend of urban architectural spaces.The urban architectural form is simplified and the basic architectural form templates are extracted, and then, the correlations between architecture form and fractal dimension are built. The results of the case study show that the architectural layout of Zhengzhou City exhibits obvious fractal characteristics, and the combination of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional fractal dimensions is helpful for comprehensively revealing the architectural layout information. Moreover, the fractal dimension of buildings shows that the gradient from the inner to outer ring decreases, similar to the 'annual growth rings' of trees. Obvious differences exist in the fractal dimensions of urban buildings in different directions, reflecting the urban expansion direction. This study promotes the visualization of fractal theory and the expression of fractal theory in spatial gradient, providing theoretical and data reference for urban spatial form optimization.","I am very grateful to my tutor for helping me to complete the topic selection and conception of the thesis, and gave me a lot of valuable suggestions on the revision of my thesis, so that my paper has been constantly improved.

In this study, down fibers were encapsulated in polypropylene melt-blown nonwoven fabric, and also in polyester woven cloth, to form two different kinds of composite waddings. The waddings made of down fiber encapsulated in melt-blown nonwoven fabrics have a superior moisture permeability, thermal insulation, and anti-drilling performance, and a slightly inferior air permeability compared to that of waddings made with traditional woven fabrics.

This study adopts the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption method, mercury injection experiment, and other methods, combined with fractal theory, to quantitatively analyze the pore distribution of coal samples inside and outside the outburst cavities of the Sanjia coal mine. The experiments have shown that the contents of aliphatic functional groups and hydrogen in tectonic coal are higher than those of aromatic structural functional groups. Raw coal has more straight chains than side chains, whereas aliphatic hydrocarbon mostly has short chains, and the branching degree is high. Soft and primary-structure coals have similar elemental content and tectonic effects endow the coal with better connectivity. The pores are filled with particles and flakes, and the surfaces of tectonic coal have more pores and fissures on them. According to the experimental curve, the pores are divided into five types. The pore size of primary-structure coal is mainly type II pores, and the pore size distribution of tectonic coal is relatively wide, with the majority being class I and class II pores. The specific surface area of tectonic coal is 60.7% more than that of primary-structure coal. The box fractal dimension of coal decreases with the increase in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) magnification. The minimum fractal dimension of tectonic coal is 2.49, which is 7.8% lower than the peak of 2.70. It can be seen from the fractal dimension that the fractal dimensions of pore types II, III, and IV are rougher.",The authors appreciate the support from the above funders.,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant number 52104079 and by the Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Projects under Grant number [2020]­4Y050.,ACS Omega,,,,2022-07-25,2022,2022-07-25,2022-08-09,7,31,27300-27311,,,"Lin, Huaying; Tian, Shixiang; Jiao, Anjun; Cao, Zuoyong; Song, Kai; Zou, Yihuai","Lin, Huaying (College of Mining Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, Guizhou, China); Tian, Shixiang (College of Mining Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, Guizhou, China; The National Joint Engineering Laboratory for the Utilization of Dominant Mineral Resources in Karst Mountain Area, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, Guizhou, China); Jiao, Anjun (College of Mining Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, Guizhou, China); Cao, Zuoyong (Institute of Mining Engineering, Guizhou Institute of Technology, Guiyang, 550000, Guizhou, China; Guizhou Administration of Coal Safety, Guiyang, 550000, Guizhou, China); Song, Kai (College of Safety and Ocean Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Beijing, 102249, China); Zou, Yihuai (College of Mining Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, Guizhou, China)","Tian, Shixiang (Guizhou University; Guizhou University)","Lin, Huaying (Guizhou University); Tian, Shixiang (Guizhou University; Guizhou University); Jiao, Anjun (Guizhou University); Cao, Zuoyong (Guizhou Institute of Technology; Guizhou Administration of Coal Safety, Guiyang, 550000, Guizhou, China); Song, Kai (China University of Petroleum, Beijing); Zou, Yihuai (Guizhou University)",3,3,0.72,0.85,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.2c02222,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149730060,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry,

Patient records and pretreatment panoramic radiographs were evaluated. The regions of interest selected for calculating fractal dimension were the bilateral mental foramen regions of the mandible. Fractal dimension was set in relation to orthodontic treatment duration using a linear regression model which was also adjusted for potential confounding variables. Total treatment duration was the outcome variable of interest used as a continuous variable. The predictor variables of interest included age, gender, type of dental and skeletal malocclusion, vertical growth pattern, extraction type, and fractal dimension.ResultsThe mean age, treatment duration, and fractal dimension were 14.56 years, 27.01 months, and 1.23 mm, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the fractal dimension had a significant influence on overall treatment duration (P < 0.001). From the other variables, Angle class II malocclusion significantly influenced treatment duration (P < 0.01), age showed a significant negative correlation with treatment duration (P < 0.01), and treatment duration significantly increased for patients with tooth extractions (P < 0.001).ConclusionThere was a negative correlation between fractal dimensions at the mandibular mental region and total orthodontic treatment duration.

With the development of CBM extraction technology, it is recognized that the migration of reservoir fluid in the fracture network is affected by the matrix fracture structure, fracture width, and pulverized coal particles plugging, therefore the fluid-particle coupling problem has received increasing attention. In this paper, six groups of fracture models with different fractal dimensions are established using the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function, and the fluid-particle coupling phenomena in fractures with different roughness and aperture are simulated using an immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM), by comparing the numerical simulation results with the theoretical analysis, it is proved that the IB-LBM numerical method has high accuracy and effectiveness. The effects of fractal dimension, particle size, and particle concentration on the plugging effect were investigated. The results show that the plugging effect on the fracture is enhanced with the increase of the pulverized coal particles content. When the concentration and size of pulverized coal particles are the same, the migration path of pulverized coal particles in complex fractures is more tortuous and more likely to be plugged. It may lead to a shift in the main seepage network of the fracture and the formation of new seepage channels. The research in this paper provides a data basis for the formation and plugging pattern of pulverized coal particles in coal seam fractures, which can provide a basis for the control of pulverized coal particles concentration in CBM drainage.",This project is granted by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41472130).,,ACS Omega,,,,2023-07-16,2023,2023-07-16,2023-07-25,8,29,26369-26378,,,"Tang, Songlei; Liu, Qiang; Tang, Hong; Yang, Feng","Tang, Songlei (Xi’an Modern Chemistry Research Institution, Xi’an, 710065, China); Liu, Qiang (Xi’an Modern Chemistry Research Institution, Xi’an, 710065, China); Tang, Hong (Xi’an Modern Chemistry Research Institution, Xi’an, 710065, China); Yang, Feng (Xi’an Modern Chemistry Research Institution, Xi’an, 710065, China)","Tang, Songlei (Xi’an Modern Chemistry Research Institution, Xi’an, 710065, China)","Tang, Songlei (Xi’an Modern Chemistry Research Institution, Xi’an, 710065, China); Liu, Qiang (Xi’an Modern Chemistry Research Institution, Xi’an, 710065, China); Tang, Hong (Xi’an Modern Chemistry Research Institution, Xi’an, 710065, China); Yang, Feng (Xi’an Modern Chemistry Research Institution, Xi’an, 710065, China)",0,0,,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.3c02902,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160748858,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

As a type of neurological disease, the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease are still difficult to accurately study. In this paper, a method is proposed to forecast the number of incident cases (NumIn), incidence rate (InRa), the number of prevalent cases (NumPr), and prevalence rate (PrRa) of Parkinson's disease in ten countries selected. Using past data on the incidence rate, the number of prevalent cases, and the prevalence rate from 1990 to 2019, three types of fractal interpolations with different fractal dimensions are constructed for reconstructing the past data, where the vertical scaling factors are determined by the method proposed in this article. Then, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed to forecast the values of NumIn, InRa, NumPr, and PrRa with Parkinson's disease in 2020. Meanwhile, the autoregressive integrated moving average model is used to predict the values compared with the LSTM model. The evaluation metrics employed for error calculation include the root mean square error and the coefficient of determination (R2). According to the proposed optimal criteria, the best predicted results are the average of three types of prediction values based on the LSTM model by analyzing and comparing eight predicted results.",This research is supported by the Key Program of the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Nos.

The structure of colloids is often characterized using the mass fractal dimension  d f $d_f$  , which is different from the two-dimensional (2D) fractal dimension  d p $d_p$  that can be computed from microscopy images. In this work, we propose to use a recent morphological aggregation model to find a relationship between 2D image fractal dimension and 3D mass fractal dimension of aggregates and agglomerates. Our case study is represented by scanning transmission electron microscopy images of boehmite colloidal suspensions. The behaviour of the computed  d f $d_f$  at different acid and base concentration shows a fair agreement with the results of small angle x-ray scattering and with the literature, enabling to use the  d f $d_f$  versus  d p $d_p$  relationship to study the impact of the composition of the colloidal suspension on the density of colloidal aggregates and agglomerates.","SAXS experiments were performed on the SWING beamline at SOLEIL Synchrotron, France.

There are three central questions in the study of KPZ growth: the determination of height probability distributions; the search for ever more precise universal growth exponents; and the apparent absence of a fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) for spatial dimension d>1. Notably, these questions were answered exactly only for 1+1 dimensions. In this work, we propose a new FDT valid for the KPZ problem in d+1 dimensions. This is achieved by rearranging terms and identifying a new correlated noise which we argue to be characterized by a fractal dimension dn. We present relations between the KPZ exponents and two emergent fractal dimensions, namely df, of the rough interface, and dn. Also, we simulate KPZ growth to obtain values for transient versions of the roughness exponent α, the surface fractal dimension df and, through our relations, the noise fractal dimension dn. Our results indicate that KPZ may have at least two fractal dimensions and that, within this proposal, an FDT is restored. Finally, we provide new insights into the old question about the upper critical dimension of the KPZ universality class.",,"This work was supported by the Fundação de Apoio a Pesquisa do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ), Grant No. E-26/203953/2022 (F.A.O.).

To reveal and to quantitatively describe the fractal scaling of the considered data, three selected methods, structure function scaling, Higuchi, and detrended fluctuation analysis are applied. The obtained results show temporal variation of the fractal dimension of geomagnetic field components, revealing differences between their irregularity (complexity). The values of fractal dimension seem to be sensitive to the physical conditions connected with the interplanetary shock, the coronal mass ejection, the corotating interaction region, and the high-speed stream passage during the storm development.

This study aimed to explore the characteristics of soil grain size distribution (GSD) in Tamarix cones across the Taklimakan Desert, verify the relationships between soil grain composition and the fractal dimension, and analyze the relationships between soil GSD and environmental factors. Soils of the Tamarix cones from 0 to 500 cm soil depth were sampled every 20 cm at four sites (Qiemo, Qira, Aral, and Tazhong) along the periphery to the hinterland of the Taklimakan Desert. A total of 300 soil samples were collected to measure soil grain sizes and soil properties. Soil grain size composition was dominated by silt and very fine sand, and the fraction of fine particles decreased and that of the coarse particles increased with soil depth, except for at Tazhong. This suggested that suspension-size particles are the main component of the soil GSD and decrease with the increasing depth in the profiles at the Tamarix cones. The soils were poorly and moderately poorly sorted. Kurtosis generally showed a mesokurtic peak, and the GSD was negatively skewed towards the coarser particles. The fractal dimensions of GSD decreased in the following order Qiemo (2.30) > Qira (2.07) > Aral (1.99) > Tazhong (1.96) because of the increase of coarse particles. The fractal dimension had a strong positive correlation with the clay and silt fractions, and a strong negative correlation with the sand fraction, indicating that the fractal dimension can reflect the characteristics of the soil GSD. The strong relationships between the fractal dimensions and selected soil properties indicate that the fractal dimension can not only quantify changes in soil properties, but also reflect the degree of desertification and degradation in the desert region. Considering the strong wind activities and different deposition sources in the Taklimakan Desert, this study provides a deep insight into the soil formation processes of Tamarix cones within extreme arid desert ecosystems.","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (2021D01B71), the Scientific Foundation for Outstanding Young Teachers of Xinjiang Normal University (XJNU202011), the Natural Science Foundation of China-Xinjiang United Fund (U1803245), the Key Project of Scientific Research Program of Higher Education institutions of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XJEDU2019I021), the Natural Science Foundation of China (41761075, 42067067).",,Scientific Reports,,,China; Clay; Ecosystem; Edible Grain; Fractals; Particle Size; Sand; Soil; Tamaricaceae,2022-09-30,2022,2022-09-30,,12,1,16461,,,"Dong, Zhengwu; Mao, Donglei; Ye, Mao; Li, Shengyu; Ma, Xiaodong; Liu, Suiyunhao","Dong, Zhengwu (College of Life Science, Xinjiang Normal University, 830046, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China; Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Special Species Conservation and Regulatory Biology, 830054, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China); Mao, Donglei (College of Geographic Science and Tourism, Xinjiang Normal University, 830046, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China); Ye, Mao (College of Geographic Science and Tourism, Xinjiang Normal University, 830046, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China); Li, Shengyu (Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 830011, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China); Ma, Xiaodong (College of Life Science, Xinjiang Normal University, 830046, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China; Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Special Species Conservation and Regulatory Biology, 830054, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China); Liu, Suiyunhao (College of Life Science, Xinjiang Normal University, 830046, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China; Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Special Species Conservation and Regulatory Biology, 830054, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China)","Dong, Zhengwu (Xinjiang Normal University; Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Special Species Conservation and Regulatory Biology, 830054, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China); Ye, Mao (Xinjiang Normal University)","Dong, Zhengwu (Xinjiang Normal University; Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Special Species Conservation and Regulatory Biology, 830054, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China); Mao, Donglei (Xinjiang Normal University); Ye, Mao (Xinjiang Normal University); Li, Shengyu (Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography); Ma, Xiaodong (Xinjiang Normal University; Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Special Species Conservation and Regulatory Biology, 830054, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China); Liu, Suiyunhao (Xinjiang Normal University; Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Special Species Conservation and Regulatory Biology, 830054, Ürümqi, People’s Republic of China)",6,6,,3.85,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20755-x.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151478698,41 Environmental Sciences; 4106 Soil Sciences,15 Life on Land

However, measurement of the surface fractal dimension has been intensively investigated and is still very problematic. In this work, we report the behavior of the effective fractal dimension in the context of film growth involving lattice models believed to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Our results, which are presented for growth in a d-dimensional substrate (d=1,2) and use the three-point sinuosity (TPS) method, show universal scaling of the measure M, which is defined in terms of discretization of the Laplacian operator applied to the height of the film surface, M=t^{δ}g[Θ], where t is the time, g[Θ] is a scale function, δ=2β, Θ≡τt^{-1/z}, β, and z are the KPZ growth and dynamical exponents, respectively, and τ is a spatial scale length used to compute M. Importantly, we show that the effective fractal dimensions are consistent with the expected KPZ dimensions for d=1,2, if Θ≲0.3, which include a thin film regime for the extraction of the fractal dimension. This establishes the scale limits in which the TPS method can be used to accurately extract effective fractal dimensions that are consistent with those expected for the corresponding universality class. As a consequence, for the steady state, which is inaccessible to experimentalists studying film growth, the TPS method provided effective fractal dimension consistent with the KPZ ones for almost all possible τ, i.e., 1≲τ","This work was supported by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Grants No. 312497/2018-0 (F.A.O.) and No. 310311/2020-9 (T.A.d.A. ), and the Fundação de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF), Grant No. FAPDF- 00193-00000120/2019-79.

Furthermore, Thermogravimetric, Nanoindentation, and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance tests were used to explore the influencing factors of pore size distribution and its corresponding multi-fractal dimension. Finally, the correlations among the pore size distribution, related fractal dimensions, and compression strength were analyzed. Results indicate that the MK-UFA cement ternary cementation system (TCS) can improve the compressive strength and fluidity of samples and enhance the hydration degree and micromechanical properties of the cementitious system. TCS effectively refines the pore size and increases microporosity. In addition, micropore and its fractal dimension have a stronger correlation with the compressive strength of composite cement-based materials. Furthermore, the micro-fractal dimensions can better reflect the essential characteristics of the composite cementitious system. The higher the degree of hydration of the cementitious system and the nanomechanical properties of the C-(A)-S-H gel, the lower the micro-fractal dimension. Finally, the GM (1,3) prediction model of compressive strength, micro-fractal dimension, and microporosity are established based on the grey relational theory.","The authors would like to thank the Associate Editor, Editor, and the anonymous reviewers for carefully reading the paper and for their comments, which greatly improved the paper.","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number: 11762014.",Materials,,F.

It is used to characterize highly irregular objects in nature containing statistical self-similarity such as mountains, snowflakes, clouds, coastlines, borders etc. In this article, box dimension (a version of fractal dimension) of the border of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is computed using a multicore parallel processing algorithm based on the classical box-counting method. A power law relation is obtained from numerical simulations which relates the length of the border with the scale size and provides a very close estimate of the actual length of the KSA border within the scaling regions and scaling effects on the length of KSA border are considered. The algorithm presented in the article is shown to be highly scalable and efficient and the speedup of the algorithm is computed using Amdahl's and Gustafson's laws. For simulations, a high performance parallel computer is employed using Python codes and QGIS software.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

For this purpose, the rheological test of CGBM with fractal aggregate particle size distribution was carried out, and variations of static yield stress, dynamic yield stress, and plastic viscosity were investigated as a function of fractal dimension and time. The results reveal that aggregate particle size distribution exerts a significant influence upon the rheological properties of CGBM, and with the escalation of the fractal dimension of the aggregate, the yield stress and plastic viscosity initially decline and then increase. In addition, with elapsing time, the correlation between the static yield stress and the fractal dimension of CGBM specimens increases, while the correlations between the dynamic yield stress and the plastic viscosity and the fractal dimension decrease. The relationships between rheological parameters and fractal dimensions at different times are established based on the experimental results. The influence mechanism of aggregate particle size distribution on CGBM is analyzed from the perspective of the aggregate packing state.

This chapter reviews fractal dimension studies in aging and neurodegenerative disorders in the literature. Research has shown that the fractal dimension of the left cerebral hemisphere increases until adolescence and then decreases with aging, while the fractal dimension of the right hemisphere continues to increase until adulthood. Studies in neurodegenerative diseases demonstrated a decline in the fractal dimension of the gray matter and white matter in Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinocerebellar ataxia. In multiple sclerosis, the white matter fractal dimension decreases, but conversely, the fractal dimension of the gray matter increases at specific stages of disease. There is also a decline in the gray matter fractal dimension in frontotemporal dementia and multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type and in the white matter fractal dimension in epilepsy and stroke. Region-specific changes in fractal dimension have also been found in Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.

The distribution characteristics of the structures using carbonyl iron/carbon nanotube hybrid material for the key absorption frequency band are obtained.

Fractal analysis plays a crucial role by quantitatively measuring the complexity and self-similarity of particle structures. This approach allows for the numerical evaluation of aggregation and segregation phenomena, providing valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms at play. Textural analysis contributes to the characterization of patterns and spatial correlations observed in particle images. The examination of textural features offers an additional understanding of particle arrangement and organization. Consequently, it aids in validating the accuracy of particle size distribution measurements. To this end, by incorporating fractal and structural analysis, a methodology that enhances the reliability and accuracy of particle size distribution validation is obtained.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate COVID-19's rapidly changing trends. The fractal dimension has been proposed as a viable method to characterize COVID-19 curves since epidemic data is often subject to considerable heterogeneity. In this study, we aim to investigate the association between various socio-demographic factors and the complexity of the COVID-19 curve as quantified through its fractal dimension.
Methods: We collected population indicators data (ethnic composition, socioeconomic status, number of inhabitants, population density, the older adult population proportion, vaccination rate, satisfaction, and trust in the government) at the level of the statistical sector in Belgium. We compared these data with fractal dimension indicators of COVID-19 incidence between 1 January - 31 December 2021 using canonical correlation analysis.
Results: Our results showed that these population indicators have a significant association with COVID-19 incidences, with the highest explanatory and predictive power coming from the number of inhabitants, population density, and ethnic composition.

Several models propose a two step aggregation mechanism, consisting of linear growth of fibrils and secondary growth involving branch formation. Single molecule imaging techniques such as total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy can provide direct evidence of such mechanisms, however, analyzing such large data-sets is challenging. In this paper, we analyze for the first time, images of growing amyloid fibrils obtained from TIRF microscopy using the techniques of fractal geometry, which provides a natural framework to disentangle the two types of growth mechanisms at play. We find that after an initial linear growth phase, identified by a plateau in the average fractal dimension with time, the occurrence of branching events leads to a further increase in the fractal dimension, with a final saturation value≈2. This provides direct evidence of the two-step nature of the aggregation kinetics of amyloid-βproteins, with an initial linear elongation phase followed by branching at later times.","We thank Kanchan Garai for providing experimental data.

In this paper, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and liquid nitrogen adsorption (LNA) were used to describe pore characteristics of macro-coal components, and the fractal characteristics of pores and their relationship with adsorption and desorption were discussed. The findings revealed that there were obvious differences in pore characteristics of different macro-coal components at different pore sizes. The total pore volume of vitrain and durain was equivalent, and the total specific surface area was larger than durain, indicating that the micropores in vitrain were more developed, while the macropores in durain were more developed, indicating that the specific surface area was smaller. Fractal results indicated that the pore structure of coal was more complex with the increase of pore diameter. The Da1 and Da2 of vitrain and durain were affected by larger specific surface area and pore volume. The Ds of vitrain increased first and then decreased with the content of vitrinite, while that of durain was the opposite. The relationship between the adsorption capacity of vitrain and fractal dimension Da1 was binomial distribution, and it was positively correlated with Da2. The adsorption capacity of durain samples increased first and then decreased with Da1. With the increase of fractal dimension Ds, the theoretical desorption rate and recovery rate of durain had a downward trend, that is, the more complex the pore structure, the poor the desorption efficiency.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41902175 and 41972183), the Shanxi Province Science and Technology Major Special Funding Project (Grant No. 20201101002), the Shaanxi Province Natural Science Basic Research Program Funding Project (Grant No. 2019JQ-245), the Open Project Funding Project of the Key Laboratory of Coal Resources Exploration and Comprehensive Utilization of the Ministry of Natural Resources (Grant No. KF2019-2), and the projects funded by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2019M653873XB).

Oil removal largely depends on the properties of the aggregates. This study aimed to explore the growth process of aggregates and oil removal near the anode by electrocoagulation. Four factors, current density, solution temperature, initial pH value, and electrode structure, were investigated. According to the findings, the current density and temperature have the most significant influence on the growth process of aggregates. The oil removal rate depends more on the average particle size than the fractal dimension. The results showed that the current density and solution temperature have the most significant influence on the parameters of the electrocoagulation process. With increasing current density, the aggregate growth rate and average particle size entering the stable period were accelerated, and the oil removal efficiency was promoted. The growth of aggregates was retarded at high temperatures. The change in the scope of the fractal dimension was minor, ranging from 1.65 to 1.84, during the growth process of the aggregates. Foamed aluminium electrodes were beneficial for accelerating aggregate growth instead of aluminium plates, but the energy consumption was obviously increased. The relationship between the mean particle size and mean fractal dimension of aggregates is consistent with the power function. From the point of view of aggregate growth, this study forms the basis for an in-depth understanding of the demulsification mechanism.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Low-temperature nitrogen isothermal adsorption experiments were conducted by us to investigate the pore structure of the Dalong Formation shale. We measured the specific surface area and fractal dimension of the pores and also considered the mineral fraction and organic matter content of the rock. The results show that the Dalong Formation shale contains a lot of organic carbon, with a total organic carbon (TOC) value between 1.20 and 10.82% (mean: 5.02%). Quartz and clay minerals are the main components of the shale, with quartz making up 40.30 to 85.60% (mean: 67.21%) and clay minerals making up 9.20 to 34.10% (mean: 20.26%) of the shale. Most of the pore space in the shale of the Dalong Formation is formed by intragranular and intergranular pores, organic matter pores, and some microfissures. The pore structure is complex, with parallel-plate and ink-bottle pores being the most common types. Most of the pores are 0-2 or 2-5 nm in size. D1 and D2 are the fractal dimensions, with averages of 2.66 and 2.81, respectively. D1 can range from 2.55 to 2.78, while D2 can range from 2.66 to 2.94. The TOC content, mineral composition, and pore structure characteristics determine the fractal dimension. Higher levels of the TOC content, quartz mineral content, and specific pore surface area result in a higher fractal dimension, while higher levels of feldspar content result in a lower one. There is no apparent correlation to clay minerals or other mineral compositions.",The research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundations of China (no. 42002031).,,ACS Omega,,,,2024-02-26,2024,2024-02-26,2024-03-12,9,10,11718-11729,,,"Liu, Weiqing; Zhu, Qiang; Qiao, Yu; Pan, Jienan; Wu, Wei; Chen, Luqi","Liu, Weiqing (School of Resources and Environment, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454003, China; Chengdu Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources, Chengdu, 610081, China); Zhu, Qiang (School of Resources and Environment, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454003, China); Qiao, Yu (School of Resources and Environment, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454003, China); Pan, Jienan (School of Resources and Environment, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454003, China); Wu, Wei (School of Resources and Environment, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454003, China); Chen, Luqi (School of Resources and Environment, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454003, China)","Liu, Weiqing (Henan Polytechnic University; China Geological Survey)","Liu, Weiqing (Henan Polytechnic University; China Geological Survey); Zhu, Qiang (Henan Polytechnic University); Qiao, Yu (Henan Polytechnic University); Pan, Jienan (Henan Polytechnic University); Wu, Wei (Henan Polytechnic University); Chen, Luqi (Henan Polytechnic University)",0,0,,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.3c09085,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169216508,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

When an object exhibits self-similarity, its shape remains unchanged as the scales of measurement vary because any part of it resembles the whole. On the other hand, the size and geometric characteristics of an irregular object vary as the resolution increases, revealing more intricate details. Despite numerous attempts, a reliable and accurate method for quantifying the morphological features of gastrointestinal organs, tissues, cells, their dynamic changes, and pathological disorders has not yet been established. However, fractal geometry, which studies shapes and patterns that exhibit self-similarity, holds promise in providing a quantitative measure of the irregularly shaped morphologies and their underlying self-similar temporal behaviors.

So far, the assessment of the thrombogenicity of biomaterials has been performed with the use of highly subjective descriptive methods, which has made it impossible to compare the results of various experiments. The aim of this paper was to present a new semi-quantitative method of thrombogenicity assessment based on scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of an adhered biological material deposited on the surfaces of prepared samples. The following biomaterials were used to develop the proposed method: Bionate 55D polyurethane, polyether-ether ketone, Ti6Al7Nb alloy, sintered yttria-stabilized zirconium oxide (ZrO2 + Y2O3), collagen-coated glass, and bacterial cellulose. The samples were prepared by incubating the biomaterials with platelet-rich plasma. In order to quantify the thrombogenic properties of the biomaterials, a TR parameter based on the fractal dimension was applied. The obtained results confirmed that the use of the fractal dimension enables the quantitative assessment of thrombogenicity and the proper qualification of samples in line with an expert's judgment. The polyurethanes showed the best thrombogenic properties of the tested samples: Bionate 55D (TR = 0.051) and PET-DLA 65% (average TR = 0.711). The ceramics showed the worst thrombogenic properties (TR = 1.846). All the tested materials were much less thrombogenic than the positive control (TR = 5.639).","The authors thank Barbara Zawidlak-Węgrzyńska, for assistance in biological experiments.","This work was supported by the Silesian University of Technology (Rector’s habilitation grant, No. 07/040/RGH20/1005) and The National Centre of Research and Development (grant, No. STRATEGMED2/266789/15/NCBR/2015).",Materials,,,,2022-12-21,2022,2022-12-21,,16,1,38,,,"Gawlikowski, Maciej; Major, Roman; Mika, Barbara; Komorowski, Dariusz; Janiczak, Karolina; Tkacz, Ewaryst; Tamulewicz, Anna; Piaseczna, Natalia","Gawlikowski, Maciej (Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Roosevelt Str. 40, 41-800 Zabrze, Poland; Artificial Heart Laboratory, Foundation of Cardiac Surgery Development, Wolności Str. 345a, 41-800 Zabrze, Poland); Major, Roman (Institute of Metallurgy and Material Engineering, Polish Academy of Sciences, Reymont Str. 25, 30-059 Cracow, Poland); Mika, Barbara (Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Roosevelt Str. 40, 41-800 Zabrze, Poland); Komorowski, Dariusz (Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Roosevelt Str. 40, 41-800 Zabrze, Poland); Janiczak, Karolina (Artificial Heart Laboratory, Foundation of Cardiac Surgery Development, Wolności Str. 345a, 41-800 Zabrze, Poland); Tkacz, Ewaryst (Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Roosevelt Str. 40, 41-800 Zabrze, Poland); Tamulewicz, Anna (Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Roosevelt Str. 40, 41-800 Zabrze, Poland); Piaseczna, Natalia (Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Silesian University of Technology, Roosevelt Str. 40, 41-800 Zabrze, Poland)","Gawlikowski, Maciej (Silesian University of Technology; Foundation of Cardiac Surgery Development)","Gawlikowski, Maciej (Silesian University of Technology; Foundation of Cardiac Surgery Development); Major, Roman (Polish Academy of Sciences); Mika, Barbara (Silesian University of Technology); Komorowski, Dariusz (Silesian University of Technology); Janiczak, Karolina (Foundation of Cardiac Surgery Development); Tkacz, Ewaryst (Silesian University of Technology); Tamulewicz, Anna (Silesian University of Technology); Piaseczna, Natalia (Silesian University of Technology)",2,2,0.59,0.73,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/1/38/pdf?version=1671619189,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153889335,40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering,

In recent years, computer-assisted nuclear fractal dimension (nFD) has emerged as an objective approach to predict the outcome of OSCC.
Objective: This study is an attempt to find out the differences in nFD values of epithelial cells of normal tissue, fibroepithelial hyperplasia, verrucous carcinoma, and OSCC. Further effort to evaluate the predictive potential of nFD of tumor cells for cervical lymph node metastasis (cLNM) was also assessed.
Methodology: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of OSCC tissues of patients treated with neck dissection were collected. Photomicrographs of H-&E-stained sections were subjected to the image analysis by ImageJ and Python programming to calculate nFD. The association of categorical variables with nFD was studied using cross-tabulation procedure and the Fisher exact test. Receiver operating curve analysis was performed to find out cutoff value of nFD. A logistic regression model was developed to test the individual and combined predictive potential of grading and nFD for cLNM.
Results: A significant difference between the mean nFD of healthy cells and malignant epithelial cells was observed (P = 0.01). nFD was not found to be an independent predictor of cLNM, although nFD and grading together demonstrated significant predictive potential (P = 0.004).
Conclusion: nFD combined with grading can predict lymph node metastasis in OSCC.

In this paper, the pore characteristics of vitrain and durain were analyzed through the experiment and fractal theory. The results indicated that the micropores and microfractures develop in vitrain, and that transitional pores develop in durain. The pore volume and specific surface area (SSA) of vitrain are larger than those of durain, with the micropore SSA of vitrain being 35% higher than that of durain. The threshold pressure and tortuosity of vitrain are greater than that of durain, but the mean pore size of vitrain is smaller than that of durain. The fractal dimension D1 of vitrain is greater than that of durain, while the fractal dimension D2 is opposite, indicating that the pore surface of vitrain is coarser, and the pore structure of durain is more complex. The fractal dimension Dk of vitrain is larger than that of durain, the mean fractal dimension Ds of vitrain is smaller than that of durain, which shows that the diffusivity of vitrain is weak but the seepage capacity is strong due to the developed fractures.

To further understand the influence of raw materials on rock-like materials, this paper carried out the indoor mechanical properties test and the micro-pore structure detection combining NMR and SEM. The effects of micron-silica fume (SF) on microporous structure parameters and macroscopic mechanical properties under different conditions of water-cement ratio (WCR) and sand-cement ratio (SCR) were discussed. The intrinsic relationship between parameters of different scales was analyzed. The experimental results showed that the porosity parameters of different radii gradually decreased with the increase in SF. The reduction rate of macroporous porosity was the greatest, and the decreasing rate of microporous porosity was the smallest. With the increase in SF, the microscopic characteristics of the internal surface changed from more pores, complex morphological distribution, rough surface to fewer pores, regular morphological distribution and flat and uniform surface. The box fractal dimension also showed a decreasing trend. Micro-pore structure makes a valuable contribution to the influence of SF on mechanical properties. The compressive strength and tensile strength increased with the increase in SF. The box fractal dimension and porosity of different radii were negatively correlated with mechanical strength. Different porosity parameters conformed to a good exponential relationship with mechanical properties.

This work first solves the J function under each water saturation according to its definition. Combined with mercury pressure data, the J function and logarithmic curve equation of water saturation are then fitted by the drawing method, and the fractal dimension and tortuosity of the aquifer are further solved. Finally, the aquifer's permeability is calculated using the new permeability calculation method. To verify the accuracy of the proposed method, 15 rock samples from the Chang 7 Group, Ordos Basin, are taken as research objects. The permeability is calculated using the new method combined with mercury injection data and aquifer characteristic parameters, and the results are compared with the real permeability.

This study compared the algal removal performance using continuous CCF and MCF using water samples taken from Lake Dianchi with severe Microcystis aeruginosa blooms. Removal efficiency, dosage of coagulant/flocculant, rising velocity and structural characteristics of the resulting flocs in the two processes were systematically compared. The results show that CCF could save >50 % polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and polyacrylamide (PAM) compared with MCF when the removal efficiency was both over 95 %. The average rising velocity of flocs in CCF could reach 254.3 m·h-1, much higher than that in MCF (154.5 m·h-1). In the respective optimal coagulation conditions, the flocs formed in CCF (G = 164.8 s-1) were larger (1843 ± 128 μm) and more spherical with a higher fractal dimension (Df = 1.85 ± 0.01) than those generated in MCF (G = 34.1 s-1). The Stokes's Law was found to correctly predict the rising velocity of spherical flocs with large fractal dimensions (Df > 1.7). In contrast, the Haarhoff and Edzwald's extended equation was more suitable for calculating the rising velocity of irregular flocs with small fractal dimension. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of the enhanced algal removal by CCF and lays foundation for developing cost-efficient algal mitigation processes.","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51909258), National Program on Basic Research Project for Governmental International Scientific and Technological Innovation Cooperation of China (2018YFE0110600).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Flocculation; Microcystis; Water Purification,2022-10-17,2022,2022-10-17,2023-01,857,Pt 2,159532,,,"Zhang, Haiyang; Li, Lili; Cheng, Shaozhe; Li, Cheng; Liu, Fangzhou; Wang, Peizhong; Sun, Lianjun; Huang, Junbo; Zhang, Wen; Zhang, Xuezhi","Zhang, Haiyang (Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, China.); Li, Lili (Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.); Cheng, Shaozhe (Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.); Li, Cheng (Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, China.); Liu, Fangzhou (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ 07102, United States.); Wang, Peizhong (Wuxi Gongyuan Environmental Technology Stock CO., Ltd, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214194, China.); Sun, Lianjun (Wuxi Gongyuan Environmental Technology Stock CO., Ltd, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214194, China.); Huang, Junbo (Wuxi Gongyuan Environmental Technology Stock CO., Ltd, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214194, China.); Zhang, Wen (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ 07102, United States.

The relationships between the fractal dimension and the pore structure parameters, compressive strengths, and drying shrinkage rates of AAMS composite cementitious materials were investigated with the thermodynamic fractal model. The results showed that at the age of 28 d, the compressive strength and drying shrinkage of the AAMS composite binder increased by 20.57% and 215.11%, respectively, when the slag content increased from 0 to 50%. When the Na2O content increased from 8% to 12%, the compressive strength and drying shrinkage of the AAMS composite increased by 24.37% and 129.40%, respectively. The compressive strengths of AAMS composite cementitious materials increased with increasing slag content and Na2O content, but the drying shrinkage of the system increased, and the volume stability worsened. Microscopic analyses showed that with increases in the slag and Na2O contents, the hydration products of AAMS composite cementitious materials increased, and C-A-S-H and N-A-S-H filled each other so that the internal structures of AAMS composite cementitious materials were denser, and the porosities were significantly reduced. By comparing and analyzing the Menger sponge model and the fractal model based on the thermodynamic relationships, it was found that the fractal model based on the thermodynamic relationship better reflected the pore size distribution over the whole pore size determination range, and the correlation coefficients R2 were above 0.99, indicating that the fractal dimension calculated by the fractal model based on the thermodynamic relationship provided a comprehensive evaluation index for the pore structure characteristics of AAMS composite cementitious materials, and the fractal dimension correlated well with the pore structure parameters, compressive strengths, and drying shrinkage rates of cementitious materials.",,"This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia (grant number 2021AAC03187), National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 51668001), and the Key research and development program of Ningxia (grant number 2020BDE03009).",Polymers,,"Cesare Oliviero Rossi, Pietro Calandra, Paolino Caputo, Bagdat Teltayev, Valeria Loise, Michele Porto",,2022-11-30,2022,2022-11-30,,14,23,5217,,,"Zhan, Jianghuai; Fu, Bo; Cheng, Zhenyun","Zhan, Jianghuai (School of Civil Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China); Fu, Bo (School of Civil Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China; National Energy Group, Coal Chemical Industry Technology Research Institute, Ningxia Coal Industry Co., Ltd., Yinchuan 720021, China); Cheng, Zhenyun (School of Civil Engineering, North Minzu University, Yinchuan 750021, China)","Cheng, Zhenyun (North Minzu University)","Zhan, Jianghuai (North Minzu University); Fu, Bo (North Minzu University; National Energy Group, Coal Chemical Industry Technology Research Institute, Ningxia Coal Industry Co., Ltd., Yinchuan 720021, China); Cheng, Zhenyun (North Minzu University)",2,2,1.01,1.03,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/14/23/5217/pdf?version=1669804447,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153265508,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

A case study from Lake Lugu (SW China),"Morphometrics are fundamental for the analysis of size and shape in fossils, particularly because soft parts or DNA are rarely preserved and hard parts such as shells are commonly the only source of information. Geometric morphometrics, that is, landmark analysis, is well established for the description of shape but it exhibits a couple of shortcomings resulting from subjective choices during landmarking (number and position of landmarks) and from difficulties in resolving shape at the level of micro-sculpture.With the aid of high-resolution 3D scanning technology and analyses of fractal dimensions, we test whether such shortcomings of linear and landmark morphometrics can be overcome. As a model group, we selected a clade of modern viviparid gastropods from Lake Lugu, with shells that show a high degree of sculptural variation. Linear and landmark analyses were applied to the same shells in order to establish the fractal dimensions. The genetic diversity of the gastropod clade was assessed.The genetic results suggest that the gastropod clade represents a single species. The results of all morphometric methods applied are in line with the genetic results, which is that no specific morphotype could be delimited. Apart from this overall agreement, landmark and fractal dimension analyses do not correspond to each other but represent data sets with different information. Generally, the fractal dimension values quantify the roughness of the shell surface, the resolution of the 3D scans determining the level. In our approach, we captured the micro-sculpture but not the first-order sculptural elements, which explains that fractal dimension and landmark data are not in phase.We can show that analyzing fractal dimensions of gastropod shells opens a window to more detailed information that can be considered in evolutionary and ecological contexts. We propose that using low-resolution 3D scans may successfully substitute landmark analyses because it overcomes the subjective landmarking. Analyses of 3D scans with higher resolution than used in this study will provide surface roughness information at the mineralogical level. We suggest that fractal dimension analyses of a combination of differently resolved 3D models will significantly improve the quality of shell morphometrics.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Many thanks go to Arne Ramisch (KU Leuven) who discussed several aspects of fractal dimensions with us.

To study the spatial variability of soil structure in different sedimentary environments at the basin scale, 356 sets of soil samples were collected from five typical sedimentary environments in the Yellow River Basin and the Haihe River Basin, including the upper and lower reaches of the rivers, mountain-front plains, central alluvial plains and eastern coastal plains. The particle size distribution (PSD) of the soil samples was obtained using a laser particle size analyzer, and the fractal dimension (D) of the soil structure was derived by applying fractal theory. The PSD, D and the correlation between them were analyzed by  the Pearson correlation method for typical sedimentary environments in two basins. The results show that: (1) The main soil types in the typical geological environments in the basin are sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, silty loam, and silty soil. The soil particle size in the upper and lower reaches of the rivers was higher than that in the plain areas. (2) In the plane, The D value descended in different regions in the following order: the mountain-front plain > the eastern coastal plain > the upper Yellow River > the central alluvial plain > the lower Yellow River. In the vertical direction for both rivers, the D value showed a decreasing trend with increasing burial depth. (3) The model results showed a cubic polynomial correlation between D values and PSD, which was closely related to the non-uniformity of particle size during sorting and deposition. The soil PSD and fractal characteristics are effective tools for the quantitative evaluation of soil structure in various sedimentary environments in the basin.",The authors wish to acknowledge Dr. Guizhang Zhao for advice on the experimental design of this study.

To compare the effect of clean water, clean fracturing fluid, and acid fracturing fluid on the pore structure of coal, this paper used high-pressure mercury injection (MIP), low-temperature N2 adsorption (LT-N2A), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine the pore structure of Guizhou bituminous coal before and after the action of fracturing fluid. The results show that clean water can cause mineral expansion and reduce pore volume by about 6% and clean fracturing fluid and acid fracturing fluid can increase pore volume by 3 and 12%, respectively, due to different degrees of acidity. The MIP data show that the pore structure of coal samples is more complex after the action of different fracturing fluids, and acidic fracturing fluids can increase the fractal dimension of the pore by about 7%. The LT-N2A data showed that the fractal dimension of micropores and transition pores decreased after the action of different fracturing fluids. In general, acid fracturing fluid has the best effect on the coal microstructure, followed by clean fracturing fluid, and the least effect on clean water.","The study was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0564), the Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship Fund Special Project of Tiandi Technology Co., Ltd.

In this study, the mechanical parameters of plain soil and alfalfa root–soil composite samples were measured by indoor soil tests and triaxial compression tests, and a calculation model for the slope of the Haizhou open-pit coal mine was established in FLAC3D numerical simulation software to analyze the influence of the alfalfa root system on the maximum displacement of the shallow surface layer of the slope and the relationship with the fractal dimension of the alfalfa root system. The fractal dimension was applied to quantify the influence of the alfalfa root morphology to further investigate the relationship between the fractal dimension of the root system and the optimal slope of the shallow surface layer. The analysis showed that the fractal dimension of the alfalfa root system varied at different slope degrees, i.e., 40° > flat > 30° > 50°; the maximum soil displacement of the shallow surface layer of the slope increased with slope in nonlinear increments. Analysis of the fractal dimension of the alfalfa root system and the maximum displacement reduction rate at the different slope degrees revealed that the optimal slope degree of the shallow surface layer reinforced by alfalfa varied between 30° and 40°.

To estimate machined surface morphologies, the conventional method is surface roughness, but it fails to distinguish ductile-regime machining from brittle-regime machining directly. To achieve this objective, it is of great significance to explore new evaluation methods to further characterize machined surface morphologies. In this study, the fractal dimension (FD) was introduced to characterize the surface morphologies of soft-brittle KDP crystals machined by micro bell-end milling. The 3D and 2D fractal dimensions of the machined surfaces and their typical cross-sectional contours have been calculated, respectively, based on Box-counting methods, and were further discussed comprehensively by combining the analysis of surface quality and textures. The 3D FD is identified to have a negative correlation with surface roughness (Sa and Sq), meaning the worse the surface quality the smaller the FD. The circumferential 2D FD could quantitively characterize the anisotropy of micro-milled surfaces, which could not be analyzed by surface roughness. Normally, there is obvious symmetry of 2D FD and anisotropy on the micro ball-end milled surfaces generated by ductile-regime machining. However, once the 2D FD is distributed asymmetrically and the anisotropy becomes weaker, the assessed surface contours would be occupied by brittle cracks and fractures, and corresponding machining processes will be in a brittle regime. This fractal analysis would facilitate the accurate and efficient evaluation of the repaired KDP optics by micro-milling.",,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52235010, 52175389, 52293403), and the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province (No. YQ2021E021).

If this were true, then the aggregation could be predicted and controlled. However, to obtain reliable results from computations, one needs to account for the interactions between the NPs as well as the details of the fluid velocity, thus making advances over prior efforts that either ignored the aggregation of NPs, or used probabilistic methods to model aggregation.
EXPERIMENTS: Computational experiments were conducted using the lattice Boltzmann method in conjunction with Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT). The LPT accounted for the physicochemical interaction forces among NPs. Computationally obtained aggregation kinetics and fractal dimensions of Cerium oxide (CeO2) particles, suspended in potassium chloride (KCl) solutions with different concentration, were verified against experimental results. The model was then employed to investigate the effects of ionic strength, fluid velocity, and particle size on the aggregation kinetics and the aggregate morphology, as NPs propagated in the pore space between randomly packed spheres.
FINDINGS: The aim of this study was to develop a computational model to simulate the aggregation of NPs and obtain the morphology of aggregates in confined geometries, based on the physics of NP interactions and the flow field. The most important factor that impacted both the aggregation process and the aggregate structure was found to be the concentration of the electrolyte. The pore velocity influenced the aggregation kinetics and the NP fractal dimension, especially in diffusion-limited aggregation. The primary particle size affected the diffusion-limited aggregation kinetics and the fractal dimension of reaction-limited aggregates noticeably.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Dimitrios Papavassiliou reports financial support was provided by American Chemical Society.

To study the polydispersity and irregularity of CGPCA, the CGPCA surface fractal dimension was calculated using fractal dimension combined with scanning electron microscopy. The two-section fractal dimension of the particle size distribution was obtained by fitting the logarithmic particle size distribution of CGPCA. On the basis of the obtained data, the polydisperse particle drag force model, the agglomeration kernel function, and the breakage kernel function were modified. Thus, an irregular polydisperse gas-solid two-phase Eulerian-Eulerian model was constructed to simulate the sorting process of CGPCA in the fluidized bed. The results of the numerical simulation investigation were compared with the experimental results and showed that the simulation data, which considered the two section fractal dimension, was in better agreement with the experimental results. The cumulative logarithmic distribution of CGPCA's size was segmented and fitted. The values of the two section fractals of the agglomerates were determined as D = 1.014 and D = 2.401, respectively. Analysis revealed that the optimal separation efficiency working condition in the simulation process, providing the highest separation efficiency of 54.7%, was generated at air velocity of 1.21 m/s.",This work was supported by Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department 13 Five-Year Plan Key Science and Technology R&amp;D Projects (20180201001SF),,ACS Omega,,,,2022-06-15,2022,2022-06-15,2022-06-28,7,25,21750-21762,,,"Zheng, Jianxiang; Lu, Jiacheng; Ma, Chenmin; Lv, Tai; Lu, Hongbo","Zheng, Jianxiang (School of Energy and Power Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin, 132013, China); Lu, Jiacheng (School of Energy and Power Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin, 132013, China); Ma, Chenmin (School of Energy and Power Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin, 132013, China); Lv, Tai (School of Energy and Power Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin, 132013, China); Lu, Hongbo (School of Energy and Power Engineering, Northeast Electric Power University, Jilin, 132013, China)","Lu, Hongbo (Northeast Electric Power University)","Zheng, Jianxiang (Northeast Electric Power University); Lu, Jiacheng (Northeast Electric Power University); Ma, Chenmin (Northeast Electric Power University); Lv, Tai (Northeast Electric Power University); Lu, Hongbo (Northeast Electric Power University)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9244914,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148695805,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

In this situation, striving to obtain the most uniform, smooth surface in a repeatable manner for each manufactured element should be a sine qua non condition for each supplier of orthodontic brackets. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the surfaces of orthodontic brackets using different methods. One of them-that is relatively simple and repeatable-is the analysis of the fractal dimension and the analysis of the textures of the optical images on the surface. In the presented study, fractal dimension analysis and texture analysis were performed by selecting four brackets from three different manufacturers (Mini Sprint, Sprint, Nu-Edge, Orthos SS).

Here we develop a metric to quantify time series complexity (i.e., a measure of the ups and downs of sequential observations) in chlorophyll-a concentration and show that seemingly disparate regions (e.g., Atlantic vs Indian, equatorial vs subtropical) in the global ocean can be inherently similar. These patterns can be linked to the regularity of chlorophyll-a concentration change and the likelihood of anomalous events within the satellite record. Despite distinct spatial changes in decadal chlorophyll-a concentration, changes in time series complexity have been relatively consistent. This work provides different metrics for monitoring the global ocean and suggests that the complexity of chlorophyll-a time series can be independent of its magnitude.",VA and CBM acknowledge support from the Rhode Island Sea Grant (Grant number: NA22OAR4170123 to CBM).

This complexity depends in part on properties of the space surrounding a settlement. This paper demonstrates that by introducing a dynamic approach to space and by including an equation of motion and space resistance, a dramatic change in the stylized static CPT (Central Place Theory) image occurs. As a result of the interplay of gravitational forces, basins of attraction arise around cities, whose boundaries appear to be fractals.

It has several applications, from sentiment analysis and text summary to automatic language translation. In this work, we use NLP to figure out similar structural linguistic patterns among several different languages. We apply the word2vec algorithm that creates a vector representation for the words in a multidimensional space that maintains the meaning relationship between the words. From a large corpus we built this vectorial representation in a 100-dimensional space for English, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Russian, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Italian, Arabic, Hebrew, Basque, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and Estonian. Then, we calculated the fractal dimensions of the structure that represents each language. The structures are multi-fractals with two different dimensions that we use, in addition to the token-dictionary size rate of the languages, to represent the languages in a three-dimensional space. Finally, analyzing the distance among languages in this space, we conclude that the closeness there is tendentially related to the distance in the Phylogenetic tree that depicts the lines of evolutionary descent of the languages from a common ancestor.","The authors would like to thank the Editorial Coordinator of the review panel and the referees of this journal for their insightful criticisms, comments, and suggestions on an earlier version of this paper.

Their morphology has been studied mainly with indices relevant to their qualitative characteristics. The present paper aims at presenting a new quantitative method to evaluate their complexity, by means of box-counting fractal dimension analysis, and to investigate its inter- and intra-rater reliability. Twenty maxillary plaster models were scanned for the needs of this study. A sequence of steps, including cropping of the mesh, ball pivoting, distance mapping and fractal dimension analysis, performed with Viewbox 4 software, was followed. Box-counting fractal dimensions were calculated as a measure of rugae’s complexity. Inter- and intra-rater reliability were investigated, using Bland–Altman analysis. Fractal dimensions ranged from 1.274 to 1.491 (average: 1.412). Bland–Altman analysis of inter- and intra-examiner reliability demonstrated that the 95% limits of agreement ranged from − 0.012 to 0.011 and from − 0.004 to 0.004, respectively. The method is reliable and can be applied in research and forensics.

The comorbid diagnosis of ASD with ADHD (ASD + ADHD) is permitted in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). However, compared to autism spectrum disorder without other symptoms (ASD-only), the special neural underpinnings in ASD+ADHD remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to uncover the differences in cortical complexity between ASD + ADHD and ASD-only patients. A total of 114 ASD participants (i.e. containing 40 ASD + ADHD and 74 ASD-only participants) with T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were collected from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II. Afterward, a surface-based morphometry method was carried out to compare the cortical complexity (i.e. gyrification index, fractal dimension, and sulcal depth) between the ASD + ADHD and ASD-only cohorts. Results showed the increased fractal dimension in the right fusiform gyrus of the ASD + ADHD cohort in comparison to the ASD-only cohort. Moreover, the ASD + ADHD cohort exhibited increased sulcal depth in the left middle temporal gyrus/inferior temporal gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus compared to the ASD-only cohort. Last but not least, the increased gyrification index in the insula/postcentral gyrus was observed in the ASD + ADHD cohort in comparison to the ASD-only cohort.

With the adjustment of its parameters and initial points, the novel system can generate periodic, quasi-periodic, chaotic, and hyperchaotic behaviours. For special values of parameters, we show that the proposed 10-D system has a very high Kaplan-Yorke fractal dimension, which can reach up to 9.067 indicating the very complexity of the 10-D system dynamics. In addition, the proposed system is shown to exhibit at least six varied attractors for the same values of parameters due to its multistability. Regions of multistability are identified by analysing the bifurcation diagrams of the proposed model versus its parameters and for six different values of initial points. Many of numerical plots are given to show the appearance of different dynamical behaviours and the existence of multiple coexisting attractors. The main problem with controlling chaos/hyperchaos systems is that they are not always fully synchronized. therefore, some powerful synchronization techniques should be considered. The synchronization between the high-dimensional 10-D system and a set of three low-dimensional chaotic and hyperchaotic systems is proposed. Ten control functions are designed using the active control method, ensuring synchronisation between the collection of systems and the 10-D hyperchaotic system. Finally, using Multisim 13.0 software to construct the new system's electronic circuit, the feasibility of the new system with its extremely complicated dynamics is verified. Therefore, the novel 10-D hyperchaotic system can be applied to different chaotic-based application due to its large dimension, complex dynamics, and simple circuit architecture.","The authors are grateful to all reviewers for their important comments and suggestions which has helped increase the quality of the paper.

As shown by the present study, the Fickian (i.e., the asymptotic constant) component of a properly normalized version of these coefficients exhibits a clearly detectable minimum in correspondence with the same fractal dimension (d ≅ 1.7) that seems to characterize the diffusion-limited aggregation state of cells in advanced stages of cancerous lesion progression. That circumstance suggests that such a critical fractal dimension, which is also reminiscent of the colloidal state of solutions (and may therefore identify the microscale architecture of both living and non-living two-phase systems in state transition conditions) may actually represent a sort of universal nature imprint. Additionally, it suggests that the closed-form analytical solution that was provided for the effective macrodispersion coefficients in fractal porous media may be a reliable candidate as a physically-based descriptor of blood perfusion dynamics in healthy as well as cancerous tissues. In order to evaluate the biological meaningfulness of this specific fluid-dynamic parameter, a preliminary validation is performed by comparison with the results of imaging-based clinical surveys.

Despite this, crucial aspects such as the relationship of the mobility radius, Rm, with respect to the fractal dimension, df, and the fluid penetration depth, δ, have largely remained unexplored. Herein, we examine these aspects across a wide range of df's through a Stokesian dynamics approach. It takes into account all orders of monomer-monomer interactions to construct the resistance matrix for the entire cluster, which is assumed to be rigid. Statistical fractals created using algorithms such as diffusion limited aggregation (DLA), cluster-cluster aggregation (CCA), tunable Monte Carlo algorithm, and a deterministic Vicsek fractal, with df varying from 1.76 to 3, and the number of monomers ranging from 20 to 10 240 are considered. While confirming the expected asymptotic cluster-size independence of the hydrodynamic ratio, β = Rm/Rg (where Rg is the radius of gyration of the cluster), this study reveals a monotonically increasing trend for β with increasing df. The decay of the fluid velocity within the aggregate is quantified via the concept of penetration depth (δ). Analysis shows that the dimensionless penetration depth (δ* = δ/Rg) approaches asymptotic constancy with respect to cluster size in contrast to a weak dependency of the form δ* ∼ (Rg/a)-(df - 1)/2, predicted by the mean-field theory (a being the monomer radius). Furthermore, the penetration depth is found to decrease rapidly, in an exponential manner, with increasing β. This establishes a quantitative relationship between the resistance experienced by the cluster and the degree of penetration of fluid into it. The implications of these results are further discussed.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Board of Research in Nuclear Science (BRNS), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Government of India, to conduct this research under project no. 36(2,4)/15/01/2015-BRNS.

Thus, lump anthracite samples were electrochemically modified in our manufactured device with 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 V/cm potential gradients. The changes in heterogeneity and porosity after modification were tested and analyzed by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and fractal theory. The results indicated that the total volume of the pores increased after electrochemical treatment and continuously increased with increasing potential gradient during the treatment process. After modification, the number of pores or fractures with a pore size between 6 and 20 μm in coal after modification increases significantly. According to the intrusion pressure, three stages were defined as lower (P M < 0.1 MPa), intermediate (0.1 ≤ P M < 10 MPa), and higher regions (P M ≥ 10 MPa), which are characterized by fractal dimensions D 1, D 2, and compression stages, respectively. After modification, the fractal dimension D 1 showed an increasing trend, while the fractal dimension D 2 showed a decreasing trend, indicating that the fracture system became more complicated and that the pore system became more regular after electrochemical treatment. The evolution mechanism of heterogeneity and porosity and their fractal dimensions were explained by the dissolution of minerals, change in pH values, and dynamics of temperatures during the process of modification. The results obtained in this work are of important guiding significance for coalbed methane (CBM) extraction via in situ modification by electrochemical treatment.","This research was supported financially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51674173, U1810102, 42072203, 51974193), Basic Research Project of Shanxi Province (Grant No. 20210302123148), and Shanxi General Youth Fund Project (Grant No. 201901D211452).",,ACS Omega,,,,2022-03-25,2022,2022-03-25,2022-04-05,7,13,11148-11157,,,"Guo, Junqing; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Lu, Chunsheng; Chai, Zhaoyun; Kang, Guanxian; Zhao, Guofei; Kang, Tianhe; Zhang, Shirui; Li, Hengzhong","Guo, Junqing (Key Laboratory of in Situ Property-Improving Mining of Ministry of Education, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, 030024, People’s Republic of China); Zhang, Xiaoyu (Research Institute of Mine Big Data, China Coal Research Institute, Beijing, 100013, People’s Republic of China; State Key Laboratory of Coal Mining and Clean Utilization, Beijing, 100013, People’s Republic of China); Lu, Chunsheng (School of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, Curtin University, Western Australia, 6845, Australia); Chai, Zhaoyun (Key Laboratory of in Situ Property-Improving Mining of Ministry of Education, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, 030024, People’s Republic of China); Kang, Guanxian (College of Safety and Emergency Management Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, 030024, People’s Republic of China); Zhao, Guofei (Key Laboratory of in Situ Property-Improving Mining of Ministry of Education, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, 030024, People’s Republic of China); Kang, Tianhe (Key Laboratory of in Situ Property-Improving Mining of Ministry of Education, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, 030024, People’s Republic of China); Zhang, Shirui (Shanxi Guoyuan Coalbed Methane Comprehensive Utilization Engineering Technology Co., LTD, Taiyuan, 030032, People’s Republic of China); Li, Hengzhong (Shanxi Guoyuan Coalbed Methane Comprehensive Utilization Engineering Technology Co., LTD, Taiyuan, 030032, People’s Republic of China)","Guo, Junqing (Taiyuan University of Technology)","Guo, Junqing (Taiyuan University of Technology); Zhang, Xiaoyu (China Coal Research Institute (China); State Key Laboratory of Coal Mining and Clean Utilization, Beijing, 100013, People’s Republic of China); Lu, Chunsheng (Curtin University); Chai, Zhaoyun (Taiyuan University of Technology); Kang, Guanxian (Taiyuan University of Technology); Zhao, Guofei (Taiyuan University of Technology); Kang, Tianhe (Taiyuan University of Technology); Zhang, Shirui (Shanxi Guoyuan Coalbed Methane Comprehensive Utilization Engineering Technology Co., LTD, Taiyuan, 030032, People’s Republic of China); Li, Hengzhong (Shanxi Guoyuan Coalbed Methane Comprehensive Utilization Engineering Technology Co., LTD, Taiyuan, 030032, People’s Republic of China)",0,0,,0.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.1c07286,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146565581,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

The self-affine of surfaces and the characterisation of self-affine using a fractal dimension and its implantation into tribological models are commonly used. The goal of our present work was to determine the frequency range of fractal behaviour of surfaces by analysing the microtopographic measurements of an anodised aluminium brake plunger. We also wanted to know if bifractal and multifractal behaviour can be detected in real machine parts. As a result, we developed a new methodology for determining the fractal range boundaries to separate the nano- and micro-roughness. To reach our goals, we used an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a stylus instrument to obtain measurements in a wide frequency range (19 nm-3 mm). Power spectral density (PSD)-based fractal evaluation found that the examined surface could not be characterised by a single fractal dimension. A new method capable of separating nano- and micro-roughness has been developed for investigating multifractal behaviour. The presented procedure separates nano- and micro-roughness based on the geometric characteristics of surfaces. In this way, it becomes possible to specifically examine the relationship between the micro-geometry that can be measured in each wavelength range and the effects of cutting technology and the material structure that creates them.",,This research received no external funding.,Materials,,,,2024-01-06,2024,2024-01-06,,17,2,292,,,"Czifra, Árpád; Ancza, Erzsébet","Czifra, Árpád (Institute of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, Óbuda University, 1034 Budapest, Hungary); Ancza, Erzsébet (Institute for Natural Sciences and Basic Subjects, Óbuda University, 1034 Budapest, Hungary;, ancza.erzsebet@bgk.uni-obuda.hu)","Czifra, Árpád (Óbuda University)","Czifra, Árpád (Óbuda University); Ancza, Erzsébet (Óbuda University)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/2/292/pdf?version=1704530118,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167776555,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,

KES imaging was performed in upright position during stable Xe gas (64% in O2) inhalation and iodine infusion (Iomeron, 350 mg/mL), respectively, at baseline and after induced bronchoconstriction by aerosolized methacholine (125 mg/mL, 90 s) and bronchodilator (salbutamol, 10 mg/mL, 90 s) inhalation, at two axial image levels. Lung Xe and iodine images were segmented, and maps of regional lung gas and blood fractions were computed. The Df of lung gas (DfXe) and blood (DfIodine) distribution was computed based on a log-log plot of variation coefficient as a function of region volume. DfXe decreased significantly during bronchoconstriction (P < 0.0001), and remained low after salbutamol. DfIodine depended on the axial image level (P < 0.0001), but did not change with bronchoconstriction. DfXe was significantly associated with arterial [Formula: see text] (R = 0.67, P = 0.002), and negatively associated with [Formula: see text] (R = -0.62, P = 0.006), respiratory resistance (R = -0.58, P = 0.011), and elastance (R = -0.55, P = 0.023). These data demonstrate the reduced Df of gas distribution during acute bronchoconstriction, and the association of this parameter with physiologically meaningful variables. This finding suggests a decreased complexity and space-filling properties of lung ventilation during bronchoconstriction, and could serve as a functional imaging biomarker in obstructive airway diseases.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here, we used an energy-subtractive imaging technique to assess the fractal dimension (Df) of lung gas and blood distribution and the effect of acute bronchoconstriction. We found that Df of gas significantly decreases in bronchoconstriction. Conversely, Df of blood exhibits gravity-dependent changes only, and is not affected by acute bronchoconstriction. Our data show that the fractal dimension of lung gas detects the emergence of clustered rather than scattered loss of ventilatory units during bronchoconstriction.","The authors thank Herwig Requardt, Alberto Bravin, and ESRF ID-17 staff for technical assistance.",,Journal of Applied Physiology,,,Animals; Rabbits; Bronchoconstriction; Asthma; Synchrotrons; Fractals; Pulmonary Ventilation; Lung; Albuterol; Iodine,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,2023-04-01,134,4,995-1003,,,"Bayat, Sam; Degrugilliers, Loïc; Porra, Liisa; Strengell, Satu; Petak, Ferenc; Habre, Walid","Bayat, Sam (Department of Pulmonology & Physiology, Grenoble University Hospital, Grenoble, France.; Univ.

First, we introduce the method of calculating the effective fractal dimension  D B ${D}_B$  of the network by taking a scale-free network as an example. Second, we propose the construction method of administrative fractal network and calculate the  D B ${D}_B$  . using the classical susceptible exposed infectious removed (SEIR) infectious disease model, we simulate the virus propagation process on the administrative fractal network. The results show that the larger the  D B ${D}_B$  is, the higher the risk of virus transmission is. Later, we proposed five parameters P, M, B, F, and D, where P denotes population mobility, M denotes geographical distance, B denotes GDP, F denotes  D B ${D}_B$  , and D denotes population density. The new epidemic growth index formula  I = ( P + ( 1 - M ) + B ) ( F + D )   $I = {( {P + ( {1 - M} ) + B} )}^{( {F + D} )}$  was obtained by combining these five parameters, and the validity of I in epidemic transmission risk assessment was demonstrated by parameter sensitivity analysis and reliability analysis.

ObjectivesFractal analysis is a mathematical method used for the calculation of bone trabeculation and lacunarity. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and fractal dimension (FD) of peri-implant bone to determine the preload stability of implants.Materials and methodsIn this study, the results of the fractal analysis calculated from the resonance frequency analysis results taken in the 3rd month of the patients who underwent 2-stage implant by the same doctor and the radiographs taken in the same session were evaluated. A hundred implants in 20 patients were applied in this study. The implant stability quotient (ISQ) values of the implants and fractal dimension values of the peri-implant bone were calculated.ResultsThe findings showed that the ISQ1 (p = 0.008), ISQ2 (p = 0.038), ROI2 (p = 0.013), and ROI3 (p < 0.001) values were statistically significantly higher in men than women. The ISQ1 (p = 0.003), ISQ2 (p = 0.013), ROI1 (p = 0.011), and ROI3 (p < 0.001) of the mandible were statistically higher than the maxilla. The fractal dimension cut-off value to assess prosthetic loading was found 1.198.ConclusionFractal analysis is a non-invasive method that can be used in conjunction with clinical examination in the prosthetic loading decision of implants. It is a valuable parameter that can be used without the need for an extra device when it is necessary to reduce the clinical study time.Clinical relevanceCalculating the fractal dimension of the peri-implant bone is a practical, economical, and applicable method for clinicians. FD calculated from panoramic radiographs used for diagnosis in routine treatments in clinics where access to the necessary devices for ISQ measurement is not available will contribute to clinical practice.","We would like to thank the radiology technician and staff of the Nuh Naci Yazgan, University Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology.

The purpose of the present research was to use a new method of fractal dimension measurement on benchmark materials (silica glass, Viosil SX, Shin-Etsu, n = 13, and silicon nitride standard reference material, SRM2100, NIST, n = 10), to compare the fracture toughness calculated using different methods, and to study the effect of noise filtering on the fractal dimension and fracture surface roughness. Fracture toughness was determined using surface crack in flexure method according to ASTM C1421 and fractal analysis method. Fractal dimension was determined using the Minkowski Cover algorithm on atomic force microscope scans of epoxy replicas of fracture surfaces. The mean ± standard deviation of fracture toughness using surface crack in flexure method and fractals method were 0.97 ± 0.18 MPa·m1/2 and 1.03 ± 0.07 MPa·m1/2 for silica glass and 4.62 ± 0.14 MPa·m1/2 and 2.54 ± 0.07 MPa·m1/2 for silicon nitride, respectively. The mean ± standard deviation of fractal dimension was 2.17 ± 0.03 for silica glass and 2.13 ± 0.01 for silicon nitride. The mean ten-point roughness (Rz) before and after noise filtering was 89 ± 102 nm and 87 ± 101 nm for silica glass and 355 ± 132 nm and 357 ± 134 nm for silicon nitride, respectively. Noise filtering had no significance on the fracture surface roughness of the two materials. The newly developed fractal analysis method can be used to predict the baseline fracture toughness of specimens with unknown failure stress.",This work was supported by the National Institutes for Health grant R01DE024333.,,Journal of Materials Science,,,,2022-05-27,2022,2022-05-27,2022-06,57,22,10051-10058,,,"Key, W.

These systems can be characterized by physical quantities such as entropy, information, chaoticity or fractality rather than classical quantities such as time, velocity, energy or temperature. The drawback of these complexity quantities is that their definitions are not always mathematically exact and computational algorithms provide estimates rather than exact values. Typically, evaluations can be cumbersome, necessitating specialized tools. We are therefore introducing ComsystanJ, a novel and user-friendly software suite, providing a comprehensive set of plugins for complex systems analysis, without the need for prior programming knowledge. It is platform independent, end-user friendly and extensible. ComsystanJ combines already known algorithms and newer methods for generalizable analysis of 1D signals, 2D images and 3D volume data including the generation of data sets such as signals and images for testing purposes. It is based on the framework of the open-source image processing software Fiji and ImageJ2. ComsystanJ plugins are macro recordable and are maintained as open-source software. ComsystanJ includes effective surrogate analysis in all dimensions to validate the features calculated by the different algorithms. Future enhancements of the project will include the implementation of parallel computing for image stacks and volumes and the integration of artificial intelligence methods to improve feature recognition and parameter calculation.","Code availability: ComsystanJ is freely available, open source and hosted on GitHub.

Random regular graph and various undirected standard random graph models were modified by controlling reciprocity and hopping asymmetry parameters. We found the emergence of left, biorthogonal, and right localized states depending on both parameters and graph structure properties such as node degree d. For directed random graphs, the occurrence of biorthogonal localization near exceptional points is described analytically and numerically. The clustering of localized states near the center of the spectrum and the corresponding mobility edge for left and right states are shown numerically. Structural features responsible for localization, such as topologically invariant nodes or drains and sources, were also described. Considering the diagonal disorder, we observed the disappearance of localization dependence on reciprocity around W∼20 for a random regular graph d=4. With a small diagonal disorder, the average biorthogonal fractal dimension drastically reduces.

Spatially complex structures are often analyzed via the fractal dimension; however, established methods for calculating this quantity either provide a single dimension for an entire object or a spatially distributed dimension that only considers binary images. These neglect valuable information related to collagen density in images of fibrotic tissue. We sought to develop a fractal analysis that can be applied to 3-dimensional (3D) images of fibrotic tissue. A fractal dimension map for each image was calculated by determining a single fractal dimension for a small area surrounding each image pixel, using fiber thickness as the third dimension. We found that this local fractal dimension increased with age and with progression of fibrosis regardless of collagen content. Our new method of distributed 3D fractal analysis can thus distinguish between changes in collagen content and organization induced by fibrosis.","This study was supported by NIH grants T32 HL-076122, R35 HL-135828, R01 AG074488 and U01 HL-139466.",,Histochemistry and Cell Biology,,,Humans; Fractals; Fibrosis; Collagen,2023-11-08,2023,2023-11-08,2024-01,161,1,29-42,,,"Casey, Dylan T.; Lahue, Karolyn G.; Mori, Vitor; Herrmann, Jacob; Hall, Joseph K.; Suki, Béla; Janssen-Heininger, Yvonne M.

This work has coincided with the discovery that objects with fractal dimension are relatively common in the natural and human-produced worlds. One particularly successful model of fractal growth is the diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) model, a model as notable for its simplicity as for its complex and varied behavior. It has been modified and used to simulate fractal growth processes in numerous experimental and empirical contexts. In this work, we present an alternative fractal growth model that is based on a growing mass that bonds to particles in a surrounding medium and then exerts a force on them in an iterative process of growth and contraction. The resulting structure is a spreading triangular network rather than an aggregate of spheres, and the model is conceptually straightforward. To the best of our knowledge, this model is unique and differs in its dynamics and behavior from the DLA model and related particle aggregation models. We explore the behavior of the model, demonstrate the range of model output, and show that model output can have a variable fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.83 that depends on model parameters. We also apply the model to simulating the development of polymer thin films prepared using spin-coating which also exhibit variable fractal dimensions. We demonstrate how the model can be adjusted to different dewetting conditions as well as how it can be used to simulate the modification of the polymer morphology under solvent annealing.",We wish to thank two reviewers whose comments and critiques improved the work presented here.,"SL was funded by the National Science Foundation, grant number DMR-1807186 (nsf.gov).

In this study, X-ray diffractometer (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), gas adsorption (N2 and CO2), and fractal theory were employed to systematically characterize the pore attributes of the marine Wufeng-Longmaxi formation shales. The information of various pores and microfractures among lithofacies was extracted and quantified via high-resolution FE-SEM image stitching technology. Shales were classified into four types based on mineral compositions, and siliceous shales possess the largest SEM-based surface porosity (2.84%) and the largest pore volume (PV) (average 0.0243 cm3/g) as well as specific surface area (SSA) (average 28.06 m2/g). The effect of lithofacies variation on the PV of shale is minor. In contrast, the lithofacies variation has a significant impact on the SSA, and the SSA of siliceous shale is 39.11% higher than that of argillaceous shale. PV and SSA show strong positive correlation with the total organic carbon (TOC) content but negative correlation with clay minerals. Siliceous shales have the greatest fractal dimension D1 (pore surface roughness) (average 2.6821), which is contributed by abundant organic matter pores with more complicated boundaries. The largest fractal dimension D2 (pore structure complexity) (average 2.8263) is found in mixed shales, which is attributed to well-developed intraparticle (intraP) pores associated with carbonate mineral dissolution. This indicates that siliceous shales have the highest methane adsorption capacity and that shale gas desorption, diffusion, and seepage are more difficult in mixed shales.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos 11802312, U1762216, and 11802313).

The use of fractal analysis method is being investigated in order to differentiate periodontal disease radiographically. Fractal analysis presents the degree of complexity in the structure of fractal objects as a numerical data, and has been used to measure changes in trabecular bone. The aim of this study was to compare the trabecular bone fractal dimension (FD) values of patients with periodontitis and gingivitis using panoramic radiographs, and to evaluate the possible relationship between age and gender with fractal dimension.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Panoramic radiographs of 64 patients with gingivitis and 64 patients with periodontitis were evaluated retrospectively in the study. Using the radiographs of the patients, FD values measured from the trabecular bone were calculated with the box-counting method in the Image J programme. The FD values of both groups were compared. In addition, the relationship between age and gender parameters and FD values was evaluated within the groups.
RESULTS: According to the results of the study, the calculated average FD value of the patients in the gingivitis group was 1.195, while the calculated average FD value of the patients in the periodontitis group was 1.196. No statistically significant difference was observed between the FD values of the gingivitis group and the periodontitis group (p > 0.05). No statistically significant correlation was observed between FD values and age and gender (p > 0.05).

Their focus on individual cell interactions makes them a particularly appropriate strategy to study cancer therapies' effects, which are often designed to disrupt single-cell dynamics. In this work, we propose them as viable methods for studying the time evolution of cancer imaging biomarkers (IBM). We propose a cellular automata model for tumor growth and three different therapies: chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, following well-established modeling procedures documented in the literature. The model generates a sequence of tumor images, from which a time series of two biomarkers: entropy and fractal dimension, is obtained. Our model shows that the fractal dimension increased faster at the onset of cancer cell dissemination. At the same time, entropy was more responsive to changes induced in the tumor by the different therapy modalities. These observations suggest that the prognostic value of the proposed biomarkers could vary considerably with time. Thus, it is essential to assess their use at different stages of cancer and for different imaging modalities. Another observation derived from the results was that both biomarkers varied slowly when the applied therapy attacked cancer cells scattered along the automatons' area, leaving multiple independent clusters of cells at the end of the treatment. Thus, patterns of change of simulated biomarkers time series could reflect on essential qualities of the spatial action of a given cancer intervention.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,The research leading to these results received funding from CONACYT-Mexico under Grant Agreement Fronteras 2019-217367.,Journal of Theoretical Biology,,,Humans; Fractals; Cellular Automata; Entropy; Neoplasms; Biomarkers,2023-03-14,2023,2023-03-14,2023-05,564,,111462,,,"Legaria-Peña, Juan Uriel; Sánchez-Morales, Félix; Cortés-Poza, Yuriria","Legaria-Peña, Juan Uriel (IIMAS, Unidad Académica de Yucatán, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Yuc., Mexico.); Sánchez-Morales, Félix (IIMAS, Unidad Académica de Yucatán, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Yuc., Mexico.); Cortés-Poza, Yuriria (IIMAS, Unidad Académica de Yucatán, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Yuc., Mexico.

This study aimed to evaluate the changes in the trabecular structure of mandibular condyles in patients who underwent prolotherapy due to TMJ hypermobility using the fractal analysis method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients who received dextrose prolotherapy at a concentration of 20% and fifteen control patients were included in the study. All patients had panoramic radiographs just before (T0) and six months after treatment (T1). The patients who received treatment were divided into three groups according to the number of prolotherapy injections. The regions of interest were selected from bone areas close to the articular surfaces of the condyles. The fractal dimension (FD) values were calculated.
RESULTS: The main effect of time on the FD value was significant [F (1, 56)=86.176, P<0.001]. This effect was qualified by a significant time×group interaction effect [F (3, 56)=9.023, P<0.001]. The decreases in FD values in all treatment groups between T0 and T1 times were significant (P=0.004). However, changes in FD values were not significant in the control group (P=0.728).

Previous reports identified several morphologic indices that predict rupture status, but they measure only specific qualities of the morphology of an aneurysm in a semiquantitative fashion. Fractal analysis is a geometric technique whereby the overall complexity of a shape is quantified through the calculation of a fractal dimension (FD). By progressively altering the scale of measurement of a shape and determining the number of segments required to incorporate the entire shape, a noninteger value for the dimension of the shape is derived. We present a proof-of-concept study to calculate the FD of an aneurysm for a small cohort of patients with aneurysms in 2 specific locations to determine whether FD is associated with aneurysm rupture status.
METHODS: Twenty-nine aneurysms of the posterior communicating and middle cerebral arteries were segmented from computed tomography angiograms in 29 patients. FD was calculated using a standard box-counting algorithm extended for use with three-dimensional shapes. Nonsphericity index and undulation index (UI) were used to validate the data against previously reported parameters associated with rupture status.
RESULTS: Nineteen ruptured and 10 unruptured aneurysms were analyzed. Through logistic regression analysis, lower FD was found to be significantly associated with rupture status (P = 0.035; odds ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.97 per FD increment of 0.05).

The presented results indicate that the fractal dimension can be a useful tool for describing different phases of urban development. Therefore, the formulated research hypothesis states that the fractal dimension of cities' external boundaries is correlated with the rate of spatial development in urban areas. The above implies that the higher the rate of spatial development, the smoother the external boundaries of urban investment. Rapidly developing cities contribute to considerable changes in land management, in particular in municipalities surrounding the urban core. Urban development processes often induce negative changes in land management and contribute to chaotic and unplanned development. To address these problems, new methods are being developed for modeling and predicting the rate of changes in transitional zones between urban and rural areas. These processes are particularly pronounced in urban space, whose expansion proceeds at an uneven pace. The aim of this study was to propose a method for describing urbanization processes that are based on the dependence between the urban growth rate, the fractal dimension, and basic geometric parameters, such as city area and the length of city boundaries. Based on the calculated changes in the values of these parameters, a classification system was proposed to identify distinctive phases of urban development. The study revealed that land cover databases are highly useful for such analyses. The study was conducted on 58 medium-size European cities with a population of up to 300,000, including France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Croatia. The study demonstrated that the fractal dimension and the basic geometric parameters of urban boundaries are significantly correlated with the rate of the spatial development of cities. The proposed indicators can be used to describe the spatial development of urban areas and the rate of urban growth.

In this study, we analyze the permeability characteristics of coal gangue filler through a set of homemade percolation test systems and introduce fractal characteristics to investigate the key factors affecting percolation in complex pores of broken coal gangue. The results indicate that the fractal dimensions of crushed coal gangue particles show an increasing trend with increasing axial loading and that the variation range is from 2.15647 to 2.58933. The coal fly ash concentration has a positive relationship with the acceleration factor. The permeability of crushed coal gangue follows a hierarchical distribution law and the permeability changes in the magnitude range of 10–11 ~ 10–9 m2. The fractal dimension is inversely related to the permeability of crushed coal gangue. The experimental results show that the coal gangue will be further crushed and that adding a certain concentration of coal fly ash can achieve a better water barrier, which provides theoretical support and engineering significance for the stability analysis of geological engineering and backfill mining technology.","The work was supported by the Postgraduate Research &amp; Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, No.KYCX22_2843.","This research was funded by the Research Fund of The State Key Laboratory of Coal Resources and safe Mining, grant numbers SKLCRSM18KF009 and SKLCRSM19KF013, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 52034007.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Coal Ash; Fractals; Coal; Mining; Water,2023-10-11,2023,2023-10-11,2023-11,30,52,111936-111946,,,"Li, Wei; Yue, Lei; Liu, Yu; Li, Shuncai; Ma, Liqiang; Wang, Jintao","Li, Wei (School of Mechanical Engineering, Jiangsu Normal University, Jiangsu, China); Yue, Lei (School of Mechanical Engineering, Jiangsu Normal University, Jiangsu, China); Liu, Yu (School of Mechanical Engineering, Jiangsu Normal University, Jiangsu, China; State Key Laboratory of Coal Resources and Safety Mining, China University of Mining and Technology, Jiangsu, China); Li, Shuncai (School of Mechanical Engineering, Jiangsu Normal University, Jiangsu, China; State Key Laboratory of Coal Resources and Safety Mining, China University of Mining and Technology, Jiangsu, China); Ma, Liqiang (School of Mines, China University of Mining and Technology, Jiangsu, China); Wang, Jintao (School of Mechanical Engineering, Jiangsu Normal University, Jiangsu, China)","Liu, Yu (Jiangsu Normal University; China University of Mining and Technology)","Li, Wei (Jiangsu Normal University); Yue, Lei (Jiangsu Normal University); Liu, Yu (Jiangsu Normal University; China University of Mining and Technology); Li, Shuncai (Jiangsu Normal University; China University of Mining and Technology); Ma, Liqiang (China University of Mining and Technology); Wang, Jintao (Jiangsu Normal University)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164873519,34 Chemical Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

The fractal dimension index (FDI) is a measure of the spatiotemporal complexity of brain activations extracted from EEG signals induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation. In this study, we assess whether the FDI methodology can be also useful for analyzing resting state EEG signals, by characterizing the brain dynamic changes in different functional networks affected by schizophrenia, a mental disorder associated with dysfunction in the information flow dynamics in the spontaneous brain networks. We analyzed 31 resting-state EEG records of 150 s belonging to 20 healthy subjects (HC group) and 11 schizophrenia patients (SCZ group). Brain activations at each time sample were established by a thresholding process applied on the 15,002 sources modeled from the EEG signal. FDI was then computed individually in each resting-state functional network, averaging all the FDI values obtained using a sliding window of 1 s in the epoch. Compared to the HC group, significant lower values of FDI were obtained in the SCZ group for the auditory network (p < 0.05), the dorsal attention network (p < 0.05), and the salience network (p < 0.05). We found strong negative correlations (p < 0.01) between psychopathological scores and FDI in all resting-state networks analyzed, except the visual network. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis also revealed that the FDI of the salience network performed very well as a potential feature for classifiers of schizophrenia, obtaining an area under curve value of 0.83. These results suggest that FDI is a promising method for assessing the complexity of the brain dynamics in different regions of interest, and from long resting-state EEG signals. Regarding the specific changes associated with schizophrenia in the dynamics of the spontaneous brain networks, FDI distinguished between patients and healthy subjects, and correlated to clinical variables.",,This work is part of the research project PID2019-105145RB-I00 supported by the Spanish Government (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033).,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,,,,2023-09-20,2023,2023-09-20,,17,,1236832,,,"de Miras, Juan Ruiz; Ibáñez-Molina, Antonio J.; Soriano, María F.; Iglesias-Parro, Sergio","de Miras, Juan Ruiz (Software Engineering Department, Research Center for Information and Communication Technologies (CITIC-UGR), University of Granada, Granada, Spain); Ibáñez-Molina, Antonio J.

Digital images were obtained using periapical radiography, panoramic radiography, and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). CBCT imaging was performed in standard (STD) and high-resolution (HR) modes. FA was conducted using ImageJ 1.3 software with the box-counting method on the images. The fractal dimension (FD) values were analyzed by the statistical software Jamovi 1.6.23. Statistical significance was accepted as p < 0.05.ResultsThe highest mean FD value was the FD on digital periapical radiographs (PaFD) (1.28 ± 0.04), and the lowest mean FD value was the FD on standard resolution cone-beam computed tomography images (STD-CBCTFD) (1.12 ± 0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between the PaFD and the FD on digital panoramic radiographs (PanFD) (p = 0.485), the PaFD was found to be significantly higher than STD-CBCTFD (p < 0.001), and the FD on high-resolution cone-beam computed tomography images (HR-CBCTFD) (p = 0.007). The PanFD was found to be significantly higher than the STD-CBCTFD (p = 0.004).ConclusionAccording to our results, in the evaluation of trabecular bone structure using FA, periapical radiographs and panoramic radiographs have similar image quality for assessment of the FD. On the other hand, CBCT results did not correlate with results from any of the other techniques in this study.","We would like to thank Lauren Penniman and Alize Dreyer for improving the use of English in the manuscript.

The device utilizes a telecentric lens to capture cervix images under light illumination with a wavelength of 550 nm emitted from LEDs. Images were obtained using the telecentric lens with or without acetic acid application to the cervix. Image processing algorithms were used to contrast and extract the skeleton of the vascular structures on the cervix. In the evaluation of the vascular density, the cervical images were divided into 12 o’clock positions, and the fractal dimension of the vascularity was calculated for each dial area between the o’clock positions. The region with the largest fractal dimension was accepted as the region with the highest probability of lesion. The range of vessel sizes was split into small classes of “bins” for each dial area with the highest fractal dimension. To validate the system’s success in differentiating between normal and HSIL lesions, forty five patients who underwent colposcopy and biopsy were included in a pilot study.ResultsThe system correctly classified four HSIL cases out of five and failed to detect one HSIL case, achieving an accuracy rate of 97.8% with an 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity.ConclusionThe developed high-resolution optical imaging system may potentially be used in detecting cervical neoplasia just before the biopsy and reduce the number of false-positive cases.",This project was funded by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey with 116S349 Project number.

However, the processing of SEM images is not deep enough. In this paper, Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software was used to extract the data from SEM images, and the parameters of the area, and the perimeter, aspect ratio and roundness of the pores in the SEM images were obtained. The fractal characteristics of the pores in the SEM image were obtained by using the slit island method fractal theory. The concretization and quantification analysis of the pores' complexity were achieved. A functional relationship model for the strength and pore parameters was constructed; thus, the influence law of pore characteristics on strength was quantitatively analyzed. The conclusions included: (1) Pore parameters indicate that most pores in backfill are irregular, and only a few pores are regular-however, the whole structure has good fractal characteristics (R2 > 0.96). (2) The fractal dimension of pores is directly proportional to the roundness, the aspect ratio, and the pore content of pores-which indicates that the complexity of pores is related to both pore shape and pore content. (3) The strength had a linear inverse relationship with the roundness, aspect ratio, pore content, and fractal dimension-which indicates that all characteristics of pores have a certain influence on the strength.",The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the instructional support specialist from Modern Analysis and Testing Central of Central South University.,This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 52274182).,Materials,,Huisu Chen,,2023-07-01,2023,2023-07-01,,16,13,4772,,,"Zhao, Fengwen; Hu, Jianhua; Liu, Taoying; Zhou, Tan; Ren, Qifan","Zhao, Fengwen (School of Resources and Safety Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China;, dr_zfw94@163.com, (F.Z.);, taoying@csu.edu.cn, (T.L.);, zt3153@outlook.com, (T.Z.)); Hu, Jianhua (Zijin School of Geology and Mining, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350108, China); Liu, Taoying (School of Resources and Safety Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China;, dr_zfw94@163.com, (F.Z.);, taoying@csu.edu.cn, (T.L.);, zt3153@outlook.com, (T.Z.)); Zhou, Tan (School of Resources and Safety Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China;, dr_zfw94@163.com, (F.Z.);, taoying@csu.edu.cn, (T.L.);, zt3153@outlook.com, (T.Z.)); Ren, Qifan (CERIS, Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon, Av.

Uniaxial compression tests were conducted on sandstone specimens with different dip angles. Based on rock energy dissipation theory and fractal theory, the energy evolution characteristics and fragmentation fractal characteristics in the process of deformation and failure of specimens were analyzed. The results show that the peak strength and elastic modulus of fractured rock mass are lower than those of intact samples, and both show an exponential increase with the increase of fracture dip angle. The energy evolution laws of different fracture specimens are roughly similar and can be classified into four stages based on the stress–strain curve: pressure-tight, elastic, plastic, and post-destructive. The total strain energy, elastic strain energy, and dissipated strain energy of the specimen at the peak stress point increased exponentially with crack inclination, and the dissipated strain energy and compressive strength conformed to a power function growth relationship. The distribution of the fragments after the failure of the fracture sample has fractal characteristics, and the fractal dimension increases with the increase of the fracture dip angle. In addition, the higher the compressive strength of the specimen, the greater the energy dissipation, the more serious the degree of fragmentation, and the greater the fractal dimension. The data fitting further shows that there is a power function relationship between the dissipated strain energy and the fractal dimension. The research results can provide a theoretical basis for the stability of rock mass engineering and structural deformation control.",The project is supported by Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (Grant Nos. 2020JJ4311 and 2020JJ5188) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51674116 and 51904101).

The oxidative acidification of tailings may cause the instability of the pond and induce serious safety accidents. The influence of oxidation and acidification degree on macro mechanical properties of tailings is discussed from the aspects of mineral composition and microstructure. The results show that as the degree of oxidation and acidification of tailings sand increases, the overall structural performance and load-bearing capacity decrease, and its cohesion (c) and internal friction angle (φ) show a decreasing trend. In fact, the engineering properties of tailings with different oxidation and acidification degrees are dominated by the physicochemical composition and structural characteristics. On the one hand, as the degree of oxidation increases, acidic substance will neutralize with CaCO3 and CaMg(CO3)2, resulting in the loss of cemented substance and the decrease of cementation force between tailing sand particles as well as the gradual destruction of the integrity of tailing sand. On the other hand, the increase of oxidation and acidification degree of tailing sand leads to a gradual reduction of outline (2D) fractal dimension and gray surface (3D) fractal dimension of surface laminated structure as well as the obvious reduction of laminated structure and its roughness of tailings sand.","The study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42002275), the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang province (No. LQ21D020001), the National Natural Science Foundation of Hunan province (No.2017JJ3263), the Key Scientific Research Project of Hunan Education Department (No.18A252), the Hubei Key Laboratory of Roadway Bridge and Structure Engineering (Wuhan University of Technology) (No.DQJJ202104）.",DisclosuresDisclosures,Scientific Reports,,,,2023-01-18,2023,2023-01-18,,13,1,981,,,"Wang, Gang; Liu, Xiqi; Song, Leibo; Ma, Xiaoming; Chen, Wenzhao; Qiao, Jiaxing","Wang, Gang (Collaborative Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Mountain Geological Hazards of Zhejiang Province, Shaoxing University, 312000, Shaoxing, China); Liu, Xiqi (Collaborative Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Mountain Geological Hazards of Zhejiang Province, Shaoxing University, 312000, Shaoxing, China); Song, Leibo (Collaborative Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Mountain Geological Hazards of Zhejiang Province, Shaoxing University, 312000, Shaoxing, China); Ma, Xiaoming (Huahui Engineering Design Group Co., Ltd, 312000, Shaoxing, China); Chen, Wenzhao (School of Civil Engineering, University of South China, 421000, Hengyang, China); Qiao, Jiaxing (Collaborative Innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Mountain Geological Hazards of Zhejiang Province, Shaoxing University, 312000, Shaoxing, China)","Wang, Gang (Shaoxing University)","Wang, Gang (Shaoxing University); Liu, Xiqi (Shaoxing University); Song, Leibo (Shaoxing University); Ma, Xiaoming (Huahui Engineering Design Group Co., Ltd, 312000, Shaoxing, China); Chen, Wenzhao (University of South China); Qiao, Jiaxing (Shaoxing University)",1,1,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26130-0.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154630852,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,14 Life Below Water

The study of the fractal characteristics (FD) of nuclear chromatin has been widely used to describe the cell nuclear texture and its changes correspond to changes in nuclear metabolic and transcription activity. Hence, we investigated whether the nuclear fractal dimension could be a prognostic factor in SCLC. Hematoxylin-eosin stained brush cytology slides from 49 patients with SCLC were retrieved from our files. The chromatin (FD) was calculated in digitalized and interactively segmented nuclei using a differential box-counting method. The 3,575 nuclei studied showed a bimodal distribution (peaks at FD1 = 2.115 and FD2 = 2.180). The 75 percentile of the FD was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival when tested together with ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status, tumor extension, and therapy in a multivariate Cox regression. Our study corroborates the concept of two main chromatin configurations in small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas and that globally more open chromatin indicates a higher risk of metastasis and therefore a shorter survival of the patient.","J.B.F. and K.M. participate in the Grant \#2020/09838-0 [São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)].

Our numerical investigation reveals the Hausdorff fractal dimension of the boundaries that separate the oscillator's intrawell and interwell behaviors. Furthermore, we categorize the interwell behaviors as three steady-state types: switching, reverting, and vacillating. While fractal patterns in the phase space are well known and heavily studied, our results point to another research direction about fractal patterns in the parameter space. Another implication of this study is that the vibration of a continuous bistable system modeled using a single-mode approximation also manifests fractal patterns in the parameter space. In addition, our findings can guide the design of next-generation bistable and multistable mechanical metamaterials.","Acknowledgments.

However, little attention has been given to the geometrical features of pores with various scales, which implies that the effect of pores on the fluid flow and storage capacity is still ambiguous and presents a significant challenge to the risk assessment of tight oil reservoirs. This study investigates the pore structure characteristics of tight sandstones by applying thin section petrography, scanning electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, fractal theory, and geometric analysis. The results indicate that the tight sandstones have a binary pore system, consisting of small pores and combine pores. A shuttlecock model expresses the shape of the small pore. The radius of the small pore is comparable to the throat radius, and the connectivity of the small pore is poor. A spiny spherical model describes the shape of the combine pore. The connectivity of the combine pore is good, and the pore radius is larger than the throat radius. The most significant contribution to the storage space of the tight sandstones is attributed to the small pores, while permeability is primarily controlled by the combine pores. The heterogeneity of the combine pore has a strong positive correlation with flow capacity, which is associated with the multiple throats of the combine pores that developed during diagenesis. Therefore, the sandstones that are dominated by combine pores and are located near the source rocks represent the most favorable area for the exploitation and development of tight sandstone reservoirs.","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42062011), the Initial Scientific Research Fund of High Level Talents in Yulin University (18GK22), the Yulin Association for Science and Technology Youth Talent Lift Program of China (20210343), the Department of Education of Shaanxi Province of China (22JK0630 and 22JK0637), the Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities, and the Department of Science and Technology of Shaanxi Province (2023-JC-QN-0347).",,ACS Omega,,,,2023-04-28,2023,2023-04-28,2023-05-09,8,18,16284-16297,,,"Wang, Wei; Wang, Ruyang; Wang, Lina; Qu, Zhengyang; Ding, Xinyan; Gao, Chaoli; Meng, Wangcai","Wang, Wei (College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yulin University, Yulin, Shaanxi, 719000, P.

We used the Taishizhuang Village Non-point Source Pollution Prevention & Control Base in the Miyun reservoir as a study area and performed a comparative analysis of the physicochemical properties of soil of the upper, middle, and lower slopes of the Scutellaria baicalensis + Buchloe dactyloides plot (Treatment 1, T1), Morus alba + Buchloe dactyloides plot (Treatment 2, T2), Salvia miltiorrhiza + Cynodon dactylon plot (Treatment 3, T3), Platycodon grandiflorus + Cynodon dactylon plot (T4), and a barren land control plot (Control check, CK), to explore how different hedgerow patterns affect the soil’s physicochemical properties, anti-erodibility, and fractal characteristics. We found the following: (1) The primary soil mechanical composition included sand particles in the upper slopes, whereas it was soil fine particles in the middle and lower slopes. (2) The fractal dimension of the slope soil showed a significant negative correlation with sand particles (R2 = 0.9791) while being positively correlated with silt particles (R2 = 0.9635) and clay particles (R2 = 0.9408). (3) All hedgerow patterns increased soil nutrients, with the Morus alba + Buchloe dactyloides hedgerow plot increasing the soil total nitrogen (STN), soil total phosphorus (STP), and soil organic matter (SOM) content by 213.89−282.69%, 55.56−58.15%, and 29.77−56.04%, respectively. (4) The Morus alba + Buchloe dactyloides hedgerow plot significantly decreased the soil erodibility factor K value, improved soil anti-erodibility, and reduced soil erosion. (5) The K value of the soil erodibility was significantly negatively correlated with clay particles, soil fractal dimension, and STP (p < 0.01); positively correlated with sand particles; and negatively correlated with silt particles, STN, and SOM. Therefore, the Morus alba + Buchloe dactyloides hedgerow planting contributes to clay particle conservation, soil nutrient content improvement, soil structure optimization, and soil anti-erodibility enhancement.",We appreciate and thank the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments that led to an overall improvement of the manuscript.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  This is a correlation description that explains the relationship between variables. The population consisted of 24 data points on 3D CBCT and 2D digital radiographs from the procedure after dental implants were inserted into the tibia of a New Zealand white rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) on days 3, 14, and 28. The radiograph was selected based on the region of interest (ROI), which covers the peri-implant area with a width of 1 mm and length following the height of the implant. The ROI was analyzed for trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), separation (Tb.Sp), number (Tb.N), and fractal dimension.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to statistically test the data to assess the consistency of intraobserver measurements and the r value (Pearson's correlation coefficient). This determines the correlation between trabecular patterns in both radiographic modalities and the Bland-Altman plot to observe the limits of acceptable discrepancies.
RESULTS:  The ICC test showed high intraobserver consistency in trabecular pattern measurements on 2D digital radiographs and 3D CBCT. The trabecular space pattern and number showed an r value of 0.88 with radiographic modalities of 0.72 mm and 0.018, respectively. Additionally, the trabecular thickness and fractal dimension had an insignificant correlation, with an r value of 0.22, and the mean of the 2D radiograph was lower than that of CBCT.
CONCLUSION:  The 2D radiograph and 3D CBCT showed correlations in the trabecular number and space results but had no correlation in the trabecular thickness and fractal dimension results. Based on intraclass correlation analysis, 3D CBCT appeared to be more reliable for measuring trabecular patterns (Tb.Th, Tb.Sp, Tb.N, and fractal dimension) than 2D radiograph.","We thank Department of Dentomaxillofacial Radiology of Padjadjaran University for all the kind support toward the project.

Such studies have revealed that many networks with scale-free and fractal properties exhibit the structural multifractality, some of which are actually bifractal. Bifractality is a particular case of the multifractal property, where only two local fractal dimensions d_{f}^{min} and d_{f}^{max}(>d_{f}^{min}) suffice to explain the structural inhomogeneity of a network. In this work we investigate analytically and numerically the multifractal property of a wide range of fractal scale-free networks (FSFNs) including deterministic hierarchical, stochastic hierarchical, nonhierarchical, and real-world FSFNs. Then we demonstrate how commonly FSFNs exhibit the bifractal property. The results show that all these networks possess the bifractal nature. We conjecture from our findings that any FSFN is bifractal. Furthermore, we find that in the thermodynamic limit the lower local fractal dimension d_{f}^{min} describes substructures around infinitely high-degree hub nodes and finite-degree nodes at finite distances from these hub nodes, whereas d_{f}^{max} characterizes local fractality around finite-degree nodes infinitely far from the infinite-degree hub nodes. Since the bifractal nature of FSFNs may strongly influence time-dependent phenomena on FSFNs, our results will be useful for understanding dynamics such as information diffusion and synchronization on FSFNs from a unified perspective.",The authors thank S.

Herein, for jointed coal under uniaxial compression with bedding planes perpendicular (sample A) and parallel (sample B) to the loading direction, an acoustic emission (AE) monitoring device and a computed tomography (CT) scanner were employed to study the damage and cracking process. Furthermore, the correlations between the AE signals and internal fracture parameters were analyzed. Results show that (1) shear and tension cracks are respectively main damage forms in samples A and B; (2) there is a drop valley of variations of AE count fractal dimension (D1) over time before the stress peak, and compared with sample B, the drop valley for sample A are much wider; (3) many fractures between joint planes formed at yielding and postpeak stages, fracture fractal dimensions (D2) first increase slightly with loading and then increase significantly at yielding and postpeak stages; especially D2 of sample A is larger than that of sample B; (4) the accumulative value of D1 (AD1) increases with D2 monotonously, and an expression of porosity or connectivity of the compressed jointed coal was developed, by which the porosity and connectivity of jointed coal could be calculated. The study outcomes could contribute to predict coal stability and the variations of water and gas flowing channels in seam in underground coal mines.","The authors would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42202210, 52304083), the key scientific research projects of colleges and universities in Henan Province (23A440003), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Universities of Henan Province (NSFRF220441), and the state key laboratory cultivation base for gas geology and gas control (WS2021B02).

The aim was to evaluate the fractal and textural analysis parameters of glomeruli in obese and non-obese patients with glomerular diseases and association of these parameters with clinical features. Methods The study included 125 patients mean age 46 ± 15.2 years: obese (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2-63 patients) and non-obese (BMI < 27 kg/m2-62 patients). Serum concentration of creatinine, protein, albumin, cholesterol, trygliceride, and daily proteinuria were measured. Formula Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Colaboration (CKD-EPI) equation was calculated. Fractal (fractal dimension, lacunarity) and textural (angular second moment (ASM), textural correlation (COR), inverse difference moment (IDM), textural contrast (CON), variance) analysis parameters were compared between two groups. Results Obese patients had higher mean value of variance (t = 1.867), ASM (t = 1.532) and CON (t = 0.394) but without significant difference (P > 0.05) compared to non-obese. Mean value of COR (t = 0.108) and IDM (t = 0.185) were almost the same in two patient groups. Obese patients had higher value of lacunarity (t = 0.499) in comparison with non-obese, the mean value of fractal dimension (t = 0.225) was almost the same in two groups. Significantly positive association between variance and creatinine concentration (r = 0.499, P < 0.01), significantly negative association between variance and CKD-EPI (r = -0.448, P < 0.01), variance and sex (r = -0.339, P < 0.05) were found. Conclusions Variance showed significant correlation with serum creatinine concentration, CKD-EPI and sex. CON and IDM were significantly related to sex.

Pore size and microscopic pore structures are the most important factors to determine the water blocking damage. In this paper, 9 core samples from tight gas sandstone with various physical properties were employed, and the pore size distribution (PSD) of the core samples were investigated by high pressure mercury intrusion tests (HPMI). Results showed that the porosity of core samples ranges from 5.68% to 13.7%, and the permeability ranges from 0.00456 to 7.86 mD, which is a typical tight reservoir with strong heterogeneity. According to the HPMI capillary curve, the cores can be divided into two types: Type I and Type II, and the pore sizes of type I are larger than that of type II. Fractal distributions were obtained using HPMI data to further determine the pore structure characteristics of tight reservoirs. The pore structures of tight sandstones display the multifractal fractal feature: D1 corresponding to macro-pores, and D2 corresponding to fractal dimension of micro-pores. Furthermore, APT damage was determined by the permeability recovery ratios (Kr) after gas flooding tests. The correlation of Kr and PSD and fractal dimensions were jointly analyzed in tight gas sandstone. Although positive correlations between pore size parameters and the permeability recovery ratios were observed with relatively weak correlations, for those core samples with very close permeability, pore size parameters (both permeability and PSD) is inadequate in clarifying this damage. The fractal dimension can well describe the complexity and heterogeneity of flow channels in pores, which can become the determining factor to distinguish the flow capacity of tight sandstone. The D2 for samples of type I and type II exhibited a good negative relation with Kr with a correlation coefficient of 0.9878 and 0.7723, respectively. The significance of this finding is that for tight gas sandstone, fractal dimensions, especially the small pore fractal dimension (D2), can be used to predict the possible APT damage very well.","Throughout the writing of this dissertation I have received a great deal of support and assistance.

A variety of research methods, high-pressure mercury intrusion porosimetry, cast thin sections, scanning electron microscopy, and fractal theory were integrated to explore these parameters of tight sandstones from the Chang 7 member of the Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin, China. Results indicate that tight sandstones are defined by three pore types with distinct fractal dimensions and corresponding pore structure, which are combined pores, isolated grain pores, and clay-dominated pores. The pore spaces of the three types gradually evolve from the microscale to the nanoscale. Combined pores were formed by dissolution pores connected to the surrounding pores and have been distinguished by their irregular shape. Their connected paths are multidirectional, resulting in better connectivity. Isolated grain pores have a small number of poorly connected paths, which causes weak connectivity. Clay-dominated pores have narrow and complex connected paths, resulting in poor connectivity. From the combined pore to the clay-dominated pore, the fractal dimensions of pore spaces decrease, indicating that the heterogeneity of pore spaces is gradually weakened whereas the heterogeneity of the flow characteristics is gradually enhanced. On the basis of the proportions of the three pore types, the tight sandstones can be genetically classified into a combined pore type, an isolated grain pore type, and a clay-dominated pore type. The differences in pore space and heterogeneity affect the distribution of tight oil; therefore, sand bodies located near the source rock, characterized by strong dissolution and dominated by the combined pore type, are favorable zones for tight sandstone reservoirs.","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 41904128 and 42062011), the Initial Scientific Research Fund of High Level Talents in Yulin University (18GK22), and the Department of Science and Technology of Shaanxi Province (2021SF-495).",,ACS Omega,,,,2022-03-15,2022,2022-03-15,2022-03-29,7,12,10627-10637,,,"Wang, Wei; Li, Weizhen; Xu, Shuang","Wang, Wei (College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Yulin University, Yulin, 719000, Shaanxi, P.

Such hybrid systems have been introduced to improve further the thermal and mass transport properties of nanoparticulate systems that affect a multitude of applications. The impact of a second particle type on the effective thermal conductivity of nanofluids is investigated here using the reconstruction of particle configurations and prediction of thermal efficiency with meshless methods, placing emphasis on the role of particle aggregation. An algorithm to obtain particle clusters of the core-shell type is presented as an alternative to random mixing. The method offers rapid, controlled reconstruction of clustered systems with tailored properties, such as the fractal dimension, the average number of particles per aggregate, and the distribution of distinct particle types within the aggregates. The nanoparticle dispersion conditions are found to have a major impact on the thermal properties of hybrid nanofluids. Specifically, the spatial distribution of the two particle types within the aggregates and the shape of the aggregates, as described by their fractal dimension, are shown to affect strongly the conductivity of the nanofluid even at low volume fractions. Cluster configurations made up of a high-conducting core and a low-conducting shell were found to be advantageous for conduction. Low fractal dimension aggregates favored the creation of long continuous pathways across the nanofluid and increased conductivity.","Computational infrastructure was provided by the Institute of Chemical Engineering Sciences, Foundation for Research and Technology, Hellas (FORTH/ICE-HT).","This research was funded by the European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Horizon 2020 Programme, grant agreement No. 862330 (“INNOMEM”).",Nanomaterials,,,,2024-01-30,2024,2024-01-30,,14,3,282,,,"Skouras, Eugene D.; Karagiannakis, Nikolaos P.; Burganos, Vasilis N.","Skouras, Eugene D.

We include rotational effects, allow diffusivities to be size-dependent as is physically relevant, and incorporate settling under gravity. We numerically characterize the growth dynamics of aggregates and find that their radius of gyration, R g, grows approximately as R g ∼ t 1.02 for classical DLCA but slows to an approximate growth rate of R g ∼ t 0.71 when diffusivity is size-dependent. We also analyze the fractal structure of the resulting aggregates and find that their fractal dimension, d, decreases from d ≈ 1.8 for classical DLCA to d ≈ 1.7 when size-dependent rotational diffusion is included. The addition of settling effects further reduces the fractal dimension observed to d ≈ 1.6 and appears to result in aggregates with a vertical extent marginally smaller than their horizontal extent.",The authors acknowledge the support of the National Science Foundation Research and Training grant no.

Quantitative retinal vascular parameters were measured from digital retinal fundus photographs using a semi-automated computer-assisted program. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between retinal vascular geometric parameters and the presence of idiopathic ERM after adjusting for systemic cardiovascular risk factors. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the two groups, except that the ERM group had a higher proportion of females than the control group.

The fluid rheology is described by the power-law model (covering shear thinning, Newtonian, and shear thickening fluids). The rough surface of the pipe is considered to be fractal, and the surface roughness is measured using surface fractal dimensions. The main focus of this study lies in the theoretical investigation of the influence of the pipe surface roughness on the velocity profile and the Darcy friction factor of an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid. The plotted results demonstrate that shear thinning fluids are the most sensitive to the surface roughness compared with Newtonian and shear thickening fluids. For a particular value of the surface fractal dimension, there exists an intersection point where shear thinning, Newtonian, and shear thickening fluids behave the same way regarding the amplitude of the velocity profile and the friction factor.

Batch flocculation experiments were performed to determine the size of the flocculated aggregates over time by using focused beam reflectance measurements. Sedimentation tests were performed to analyze the settling rate of the solid-liquid interface and the turbidity of the supernatant. Subsequently, a model that relates the hindered settling rate to the aggregate size was used to determine the mass fractal dimension (Df). Flocculation kinetics revealed that greater amounts of kaolin generated larger aggregates because of its lamellar morphology. The maximum size was between 10 and 20 s of flocculation under all conditions. However, the presence of kaolin reduced the settling rate. The fractal dimension decreased with the increase in the kaolin content, resulting in the formation of irregular and porous aggregates. By contrast, factors such as the flocculation time, water quality, and quartz size had limited influences on the fractal dimension. Seawater produced a clearer supernatant because of its higher ionic strength and precoagulation of particles. Notably, the harmful effect of clays in seawater was reduced.","Ricardo I.

Specifically, some studies identified that the SARS Cov-2 is closely related to Bat Cov RaTG13 (a SARS-related coronavirus found in bats) rather than the other viruses in that family. These studies are mainly focusing on the biological techniques to show the similarity between the SARS Cov-2 and other viruses. Examining proteins is not easy for common researchers unless for biologists. To rectify this flaw, we have to convert the protein to one of the known formats, which are easy to understand. Consequently, this study uses viral structural proteins to analyse the relationship between SARS Cov-2 and the rest of the coronavirus with the help of mathematical and statistical parameters and explores the various graph representations of MERS Cov,  SARS Cov,  Bat Cov RaTG13 and SARS Cov-2 structural proteins, such as zig–zag curve, Protein Contact Map (PCM$$\mathcal {PCM}$$) and Chaos Game Representation (CGR$$\mathcal {CGR}$$). Though these graph interpretations are visually similar, a slight variation between the graphs reflects their structural and functional differences. Thus, we use an elegant parameter known as the fractal dimension to observe their minor changes. According to the nature of the graph, we employ different types of fractal dimensions, namely mass dimension and box dimension. Furthermore, we perform the similarity tests with normalized cross-correlation and cosine similarity to assess the comparability of the PCM$$\mathcal {PCM}$$ and CGR$$\mathcal {CGR}$$ graphs.

The b-values 0.89 ± 0.05 and 0.90 ± 0.07 were computed for aftershocks after Gorkha and Dolakha event, respectively. A significant increase in b-values were reported following the Gorkha earthquake and Dolakha earthquake. The slip procured in the primary fault is respectively 60 % and 56 % after the events. The aftershocks sequences after both events were modelled by the Omori-Utsu law with p = 1.2 ± 0.11 and p = 0.76 ± 0.04. The observed b and p values after the earthquake sequences may correlate well with the large slip experienced by the seismogenic fault.

The mortar was heated to three target temperatures (400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C) at three heating rates (5 °C/min,10 °C/min, and 15 °C/min). The variations of gas permeability and porosity were measured simultaneously at different confining pressures, and the changes in mortar microstructure were analyzed by NMR and SEM techniques. The results show that the porosity and gas permeability increase with an increase in temperature and heating rate. The gas permeability and porosity continue to decrease as confinement is increased due to a reduction in the pore volume. The microstructure observed by SEM indicates that the high heating rate induces some microcracks at 500 °C and 600 °C. The fractal dimension based on NMR can quantitatively characterize the complexity of the mortar pore structure and shows a quadratic decreasing relationship with gas permeability and porosity.",The authors would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant: 51709097).,This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant: 51709097).,Materials,,F.

There is a requirement for powerful signal processing algorithms as EEG patterns in encephalopathies are not specific to a particular etiology. As visual examination and linear methods of EEG analysis are not sufficient to get the subtle information regarding various neuro pathologies, non-linear analysis methods can be employed for exploring the dynamic, complex and chaotic nature of EEG signals. This work aims identifying and differentiating the patterns specific to cerebral dysfunctions associated with Encephalopathy using Recurrence Quantification Analysis and Fractal Dimension algorithms. This study analysed six RQA features, namely, recurrence rate, determinism, laminarity, diagonal length, diagonal entropy and trapping time and comparing them with fractal dimensions, namely, Higuchi’s and Katz’s fractal dimension. Fractal dimensions were found to be lower for encephalopathy cases showing decreased complexity when compared to that of normal healthy subjects. On the other hand, RQA features were found to be higher for encephalopathy cases indicating higher recurrence and more periodic patterns in EEGs of encephalopathy compared to that of normal healthy controls. The feature reduction was then performed using Principal Component Analysis and fed to three promising classifiers: SVM, Random Forest and Multi-layer Perceptron. The resultant system provides a practically realizable pipeline for the diagnosis of encephalopathy.",The authors are thankful to the neurologists and EEG technicians for the helpful discussions and for clearing our queries related to this work.

By analyzing three-dimensional images of pyramidal neurons in the rat hippocampus CA1 region, we examine how the individual dendrites within the neuron arbor relate to the fractal properties of the arbor as a whole. We find that the dendrites reveal unexpectedly mild fractal characteristics quantified by a low fractal dimension. This is confirmed by comparing two fractal methods-a traditional ""coastline"" method and a novel method that examines the dendrites' tortuosity across multiple scales. This comparison also allows the dendrites' fractal geometry to be related to more traditional measures of their complexity. In contrast, the arbor's fractal characteristics are quantified by a much higher fractal dimension. Employing distorted neuron models that modify the dendritic patterns, deviations from natural dendrite behavior are found to induce large systematic changes in the arbor's structure and its connectivity within a neural network. We discuss how this sensitivity to dendrite fractality impacts neuron functionality in terms of balancing neuron connectivity with its operating costs. We also consider implications for applications focusing on deviations from natural behavior, including pathological conditions and investigations of neuron interactions with artificial surfaces in human implants.",,"This research is supported by the WM Keck Foundation, the Living Legacy Foundation, the Ciminelli Foundation, and the Linde Martin Institute.",Frontiers in Network Physiology,,,,2023-01-25,2023,2023-01-25,,3,,1072815,,,"Rowland, Conor; Smith, Julian H.; Moslehi, Saba; Harland, Bruce; Dalrymple-Alford, John; Taylor, Richard P.","Rowland, Conor (Physics Department, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, United States); Smith, Julian H.

Biodiesel combustion particulate matter (PM) is different from diesel combustion PM in terms of microscopic morphology, which directly affects the optical properties of PM. To investigate the effect of the microstructure of biodiesel PM on the extinction characteristics, an experiment was performed on a high-pressure common rail diesel engine to collect PM from three kinds of biodiesel (the main raw materials were soybean oil methyl eater (SME), palm oil methyl eater (PME), and waste cooking oil methyl eater (WME), respectively). The particle size distribution, micro morphology, and extinction characteristics of biodiesel PM were analyzed. Results show that combustion biodiesel reduces PM emissions by up to 84.2%. Compared to PM from diesel, biodiesel PM has a smaller particle size and a higher aggregation degree, which results in weaker light absorption capacity. With the iodine number of biodiesel decreasing, the number concentration of biodiesel PM decreases and the fractal dimension increases, which leads to producing a more complex agglomerate and a consequent reduction in extinction coefficient. The average particle sizes of PM from SME, PME, and WME are 5.1%, 6.7%, and 13.9% lower than that of diesel PM. Compared with diesel combustion PM, the peak absorption coefficients of SME, WME, and PME combustion PM decrease by 8.4%, 11.4%, and 13.3%, respectively. The extinction properties of particles decrease with increasing fractal dimension within the wavelength range of visible light.",,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51876133).,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Particulate Matter; Biofuels; Gasoline; Vehicle Emissions; Particle Size; Soybean Oil; Palm Oil,2022-10-27,2022,2022-10-27,2023-02,30,9,22458-22470,,,"Ye, Siqi; Zhang, Dengpan; Chen, Bo; Xu, Jieping; Jia, Changkai; Mei, Deqing; Yuan, Yinnan","Ye, Siqi (School of Automobile and Traffic Engineering, Jiangsu University, 212013, Zhenjiang, People’s Republic of China); Zhang, Dengpan (School of Automobile and Traffic Engineering, Jiangsu University, 212013, Zhenjiang, People’s Republic of China); Chen, Bo (School of Automobile and Traffic Engineering, Jiangsu University, 212013, Zhenjiang, People’s Republic of China); Xu, Jieping (School of Automobile and Traffic Engineering, Jiangsu University, 212013, Zhenjiang, People’s Republic of China); Jia, Changkai (School of Automobile and Traffic Engineering, Jiangsu University, 212013, Zhenjiang, People’s Republic of China; CIMC Offshore Engineering Institute Co., Ltd, 264000, Yantai, People’s Republic of China); Mei, Deqing (School of Automobile and Traffic Engineering, Jiangsu University, 212013, Zhenjiang, People’s Republic of China); Yuan, Yinnan (School of Automobile and Traffic Engineering, Jiangsu University, 212013, Zhenjiang, People’s Republic of China; College of Energy, Soochow University, 215006, Suzhou, People’s Republic of China)","Zhang, Dengpan (Jiangsu University)","Ye, Siqi (Jiangsu University); Zhang, Dengpan (Jiangsu University); Chen, Bo (Jiangsu University); Xu, Jieping (Jiangsu University); Jia, Changkai (Jiangsu University; CIMC Offshore Engineering Institute Co., Ltd, 264000, Yantai, People’s Republic of China); Mei, Deqing (Jiangsu University); Yuan, Yinnan (Jiangsu University; Soochow University)",1,1,,0.4,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-022-23747-6.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152238977,40 Engineering; 4002 Automotive Engineering; 4017 Mechanical Engineering,

However, little was known on the features of normal retina in early life. The purpose of this study was to explore the normal retinal features in the first 6 years of life and provide information for future research.
Methods: Children, aged from birth to 6 years old and diagnosed with various unilateral ocular diseases were included. Venous phase fundus fluorescein angiography images with the optic disc at the center were collected. Based on the ResUNet convolutional neural network, optic disc and retinal vascular features in the posterior retina were computed automatically.
Results: A total of 146 normal eyes of 146 children were included. Among different age groups, no changes were shown in the optic disc diameter (y = -0.00002x + 1.362, R2 = 0.025, p = 0.058). Retinal vessel density and fractal dimension are linearly and strongly correlated (r = 0.979, p < 0.001). Older children had smaller value of fractal dimension (y = -0.000026x + 1.549, R2 = 0.075, p = 0.001) and narrower vascular caliber if they were less than 3 years old (y = -0.008x + 84.861, R2 = 0.205, p < 0.001). No differences were in the density (y = -0.000007x + 0.134, R2 = 0.023, p = 0.067) and the curvature of retinal vessels (lnC = -0.00001x - 4.657, R2 = 0.001, p = 0.667).
Conclusions: Age and gender did not impact the optic disc diameter, vessel density, and vessel curvature significantly in this group of children. Trends of decreased vessel caliber in the first 3 years of life and decreased vessel complexity with age were observed. The structural characteristics provide information for future research to better understand the developmental origin of the healthy and diseased retina.",,This study was supported by Technology Support Projects from Sichuan Province of China (Project No. 2021YFS0210).,Frontiers in Pediatrics,,,,2023-03-23,2023,2023-03-23,,11,,1101768,,,"Liu, Guina; Jiang, Anna; Cao, Le; Ling, Saiguang; Wang, Xi; Bu, Shaochong; Lu, Fang","Liu, Guina (Department of Ophthalmology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Jiang, Anna (Department of Ophthalmology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Cao, Le (Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Ling, Saiguang (EVision Technology (Beijing) Co.

The geometric morphology characteristics of a carbonate rock fracture surface were studied together with an artificial rock fracture surface formed by triaxial mechanics experiments. A relationship between the geometric morphology characteristics of a fracture surface and rock mechanical properties was established based on fractal geometry. Using the Mohr-Coulomb failure and weak plane failure criteria, a rock strength criterion based on the fractal characteristics of a rock fracture surface was established. Finally, the mechanical rock properties characterized by fractal geometry were imported into the established borehole stability evaluation model. The results show that a collapse formation is mainly limestone with relatively developed microfractures, and some fractures are filled with expansive clay. The anisotropy of mechanical properties of bedrocks and microfractured rocks is obvious, whereas drilling-fluid immersion has little effect on the mechanical properties of a rock. 3D scanning experiments of artificial fracture surfaces formed after a triaxial mechanical test of a bedrock and fracture surfaces of a rock with microfractures show that the geometric characteristics of fracture surfaces after bedrock failure were more complex than those of fractured rocks. The geometric characteristics of rock fracture surfaces were numerically expressed through astatistical analysis and fractal geometry. Function relationships among cohesion, an internal friction angle, and fractal dimensions of bedrocks and microfracture rocks were fitted. A numerical simulation of borehole stability based on the fractal model of a carbonate fracture surface shows that different fracture inclinations and borehole trajectories significantly influence the collapse pressure equivalent density of a borehole wall. On drilling a horizontal well along the inclination of a fracture, the collapse pressure equivalent density of the borehole wall is relatively low when the fracture inclination is along the direction of the minimum horizontal principal stress. Unlike that from a conventional borehole stability model, the collapse pressure equivalent density calculated from the fractal model will increase by 0.1-0.2 g/cm3. The study results provide a theoretical basis for safe and efficient drilling in fractured carbonate formations.","This research work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC, No. 52174008).",,ACS Omega,,,,2022-11-15,2022,2022-11-15,2022-11-29,7,47,43022-43035,,,"Liu, Houbin; Cui, Shuai; Meng, Yingfeng; Han, Zhengbo; Yang, Mou","Liu, Houbin (State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, 610500, People’s Republic of China); Cui, Shuai (State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, 610500, People’s Republic of China); Meng, Yingfeng (State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, 610500, People’s Republic of China); Han, Zhengbo (Petroleum Engineering Technology Research Institute, Northwest Oilfield Company, SINOPEC, Urumqi, 830000, People’s Republic of China); Yang, Mou (State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, 610500, People’s Republic of China)","Cui, Shuai (State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation); Meng, Yingfeng (State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation)","Liu, Houbin (State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation); Cui, Shuai (State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation); Meng, Yingfeng (State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation); Han, Zhengbo (Sinopec (China)); Yang, Mou (State Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and Exploitation)",3,3,,1.27,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.2c05270,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152759332,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

It is of great significance to systematically study the correlation between the change of air-void characteristics and the depth of the rutting slab and establish a relationship with damage. In this paper, the air-void information of rutting specimen sections with different loading cycles (500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000 times) is obtained by two-dimensional image technology. The dynamic change process of the micro characteristics of internal air voids of two graded asphalt mixtures (AC-13 and AC-16) under cyclic wheel load is analyzed, and it is used as an index to characterize the microstructure damage of the asphalt mixture. The results show that the variation of air-void distribution, air-void shape characteristics, and air-void fractal dimension with the loading process can well characterize the permanent deformation law of the rutting slab. The fractal dimension of the air void increases with the increase in load. It is a dynamic process in which the air-void content changes with crack initiation and propagation. After rutting deformation, the total air-void area and average air-void size of the sample increase, and the total air-void number decreases. Because microcracks are formed in the specimen after rutting damage, the aspect ratio of the air void increases, and the roundness value decreases.",,"This research was funded by Beijing Major Science and Technology Projects, grant number (No. Z191100008019002).",Materials,,Giovanni Polacco,,2022-10-15,2022,2022-10-15,,15,20,7190,,,"Zhao, Kang; Yang, Hailu; Wang, Wentao; Wang, Linbing","Zhao, Kang (National Centre for Materials Service Safety, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China); Yang, Hailu (National Centre for Materials Service Safety, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China); Wang, Wentao (National Centre for Materials Service Safety, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing 100083, China); Wang, Linbing (Sensing and Perception Lab, School of Environmental, Civil, Agricultural and Mechanical Engineering, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA)","Wang, Linbing (University of Georgia)","Zhao, Kang (University of Science and Technology Beijing); Yang, Hailu (University of Science and Technology Beijing); Wang, Wentao (University of Science and Technology Beijing); Wang, Linbing (University of Georgia)",3,3,,1.19,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/20/7190/pdf?version=1666688719,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151972552,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Methods: A deep learning-based semantic segmentation network ResNet101-UNet was used to construct a vascular segmentation model for fully automated quantitative measurement of retinal vascular parameters on fundus photographs. Retinal photographs centered on the optic disc of 3107 participants (aged 50-93 years) from the Beijing Eye Study 2011, a population-based cross-sectional study, were analyzed. The main parameters included the retinal vascular branching angle, vascular fractal dimension, vascular diameter, vascular tortuosity, and vascular density. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: The results showed that the mean MMSE score was 26.34 ± 3.64 (median: 27; range: 2-30). Among the participants, 414 (13.3%) were classified as having cognitive impairment (MMSE score < 24), 296 (9.5%) were classified as mild cognitive impairment (MMSE: 19-23), 98 (3.2%) were classified as moderate cognitive impairment (MMSE: 10-18), and 20 (0.6%) were classified as severe cognitive impairment (MMSE < 10). Compared with the normal cognitive function group, the retinal venular average diameter was significantly larger (p = 0.013), and the retinal vascular fractal dimension and vascular density were significantly smaller (both p < 0.001) in the mild cognitive impairment group. The retinal arteriole-to-venular ratio (p = 0.003) and vascular fractal dimension (p = 0.033) were significantly decreased in the severe cognitive impairment group compared to the mild cognitive impairment group. In the multivariate analysis, better cognition (i.e., higher MMSE score) was significantly associated with higher retinal vascular fractal dimension (b = 0.134, p = 0.043) and higher retinal vascular density (b = 0.152, p = 0.023) after adjustment for age, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (logMAR) and education level. Discussion: In conclusion, our findings derived from an artificial intelligence-based fully automated retinal vascular parameter measurement method showed that several retinal vascular morphological parameters were correlated with cognitive impairment. The decrease in retinal vascular fractal dimension and decreased vascular density may serve as candidate biomarkers for early identification of cognitive impairment. The observed reduction in the retinal arteriole-to-venular ratio occurs in the late stages of cognitive impairment.",,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82220108017 and 82141128), the Capital Health Research and Development of Special (2020-1-2052), and the Science and Technology Project of Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission (Z201100005520045 and Z181100001818003).",Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,,,,2023-06-21,2023,2023-06-21,,11,,1174984,,,"Shi, Xu Han;

SS-OCTA images were captured and analyzed using the Plex Elite 9000 and software tools available in the advanced retinal imaging (ARI) network hub. The retinal vascular layers were defined by the instrument's automatic retinal layer segmentation. The fractal analysis was performed on the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and the whole retina. Grayscale OCTA images were standardized and binarized using ImageJ and fractal box-counting analyses were performed using Fractalyse software. Pearson’s correlation was used to analyze the correlation between FD and retinal vascular parameters.ResultsThe results showed that FD values were significantly higher in the 6 mm ring and the whole 6 × 6 scan region when compared to the 1 mm ETDRS central subfield. The correlation between age and FD was weak with a significant positive correlation between age and FD of the SCP in the 6 mm ring and between age and FD of the DCP in the 1 mm ring. Overall, differences in FD values in these healthy eyes were extremely small regardless of age or macular location.ConclusionFD values in normal eyes show little variation with age and are relatively stable across the macula. This suggests that FD values may not need adjustment for age or location when evaluated in the context of retinal disease.",,,Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology,,,"Humans; Retinal Vessels; Fluorescein Angiography; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Fractals; Cross-Sectional Studies",2023-05-18,2023,2023-05-18,2023-10,261,10,2787-2794,,,"Magesan, Kowsigan; Gnanaraj, Ramya; Tojjar, Jasaman; Amose, T; Alagorie, Ahmed Roshdy; Mahalingam, Maanasi; Sen, Parveen; Verma, Aditya; Sadda, SriniVas R.","Magesan, Kowsigan (Elite School of Optometry, Unit of Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; Shri Bhagwan Mahavir Vitreoretinal Services, Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India); Gnanaraj, Ramya (Shri Bhagwan Mahavir Vitreoretinal Services, Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; Doheny Eye Institute, Pasadena, CA, USA); Tojjar, Jasaman (Doheny Eye Institute, Pasadena, CA, USA; Department of Ophthalmology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, 150 N, Orange Grove Blvd, 91103, Pasadena, CA, USA); Amose, T (Elite School of Optometry, Unit of Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; Shri Bhagwan Mahavir Vitreoretinal Services, Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India); Alagorie, Ahmed Roshdy (Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt); Mahalingam, Maanasi (Elite School of Optometry, Unit of Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; Shri Bhagwan Mahavir Vitreoretinal Services, Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India); Sen, Parveen (Shri Bhagwan Mahavir Vitreoretinal Services, Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India); Verma, Aditya (Shri Bhagwan Mahavir Vitreoretinal Services, Medical Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; Doheny Eye Institute, Pasadena, CA, USA; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Louisville, Kentucky, USA); Sadda, SriniVas R.

This study proposes the hub-collision avoidance and leaf-node options (HALO) algorithm. In the box sampling process, a forward sampling rule (for avoiding hub collisions) and a reverse sampling rule (for preferentially selecting leaf nodes) are determined for bidirectional network traversal to reduce the randomness of sampling. In the box selection process, the larger necessary boxes are preferentially selected to join the solution by continuously removing small boxes. The compact-box-burning (CBB) algorithm, the maximum-excluded-mass-burning (MEMB) algorithm, the overlapping-box-covering (OBCA) algorithm, and the algorithm for combining small-box-removal strategy and maximum box sampling with a sampling density of 30 (SM30) are compared with HALO in experiments. Results on nine real networks show that HALO achieves the highest performance score and obtains 11.40%, 7.67%, 2.18%, and 8.19% fewer boxes than the compared algorithms, respectively. The algorithm determinism is significantly improved. The fractal dimensions estimated by covering four standard networks are more accurate. Moreover, different from MEMB or OBCA, HALO is not affected by the tightness of the hubs and exhibits a stable performance in different networks. Finally, the time complexities of HALO and the compared algorithms are all O(N2), which is reasonable and acceptable.","This study was supported by the National Key Research &amp; Development Plan Project (No. 2021YFF0901303), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC) (No. 72002017), the National Social Science Fund of China (No. 20BGL094), the Youth Talent Promotion Program of Beijing Association for Science and Technology (No. 20200016), and the Program for Promoting the Connotative Development of BISTU (Nos. 5212110901 and 5026010961).",,Chaos An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science,,,Fractals; Algorithms,2022-12-01,2022,2022-12-05,2022-12-01,32,12,123116,,,"Guo, Fei-Yan; Zhou, Jia-Jun; Ruan, Zhong-Yuan; Zhang, Jian; Qi, Lin","Guo, Fei-Yan (School of Economics and Management, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing 100192, China); Zhou, Jia-Jun (Institute of Cyberspace Security, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310023, China); Ruan, Zhong-Yuan (Institute of Cyberspace Security, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310023, China); Zhang, Jian (School of Economics and Management, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing 100192, China; Beijing International Science and Technology Cooperation Base for Intelligent Decision Making and Big Data Application, Beijing 100192, China); Qi, Lin (School of Economics and Management, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing 100192, China)","Qi, Lin (Beijing Information Science & Technology University)","Guo, Fei-Yan (Beijing Information Science & Technology University); Zhou, Jia-Jun (Zhejiang University of Technology); Ruan, Zhong-Yuan (Zhejiang University of Technology); Zhang, Jian (Beijing Information Science & Technology University; Beijing International Science and Technology Cooperation Base for Intelligent Decision Making and Big Data Application, Beijing 100192, China); Qi, Lin (Beijing Information Science & Technology University)",1,1,,1.07,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00291,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153375577,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics,

However, there is still no consensus over the definition of complexity or how to measure it. Up-to-date and clear guidance on measuring complexity is urgently needed, particularly given the rise of remote sensing and advent of technologies that allow environments to be scanned at unprecedented spatial extents and resolutions. Here we review how complexity is measured in ecology. We provide a framework for metrics of habitat complexity, and for the related concept of spatial heterogeneity. We focus on the two most commonly used complexity metrics in ecology: fractal dimension and rugosity. We discuss the pros and cons of these metrics using practical examples from our own empirical data and from simulations. Fractal dimension is particularly widely used, and we provide a critical examination of it drawing on research from other scientific fields. We also discuss informational metrics of complexity and their potential benefits. We chart a path forward for research on measuring habitat complexity by presenting, as a guide, sets of essential and desirable criteria that a metric of complexity should possess. Lastly, we discuss the applied significance of our review.","LHLL was supported by a Macquarie University Research Fellowship (#110042722), and a grant from Wildlife Reserves Singapore Conservation Fund.

The first step in this process is to reduce its particle size by crushing. This paper explores whether roasting pre-cracked potassium-bearing shale can improve the quality of the resulting ultrafine product. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the ultrafine product and its fractal dimension found contradictory results: the minimum particle size distribution was obtained by roasting for 2.5 h, while the minimum fractal dimension was obtained by roasting for 1 h. Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation was conducted with three indicators—(1) the weight of the − 10 μm product, (2) the fractal dimension of the particle size distribution, and (3) d97—to obtain a unique combination of indicators that reflects the quality and quantity of the products. The weights of the three indicators were calculated by an analytic hierarchical process to be 0.69, 0.149 and 0.161, respectively. Roasting pre-cracked shale for 2–2.5 h was found to improve the mean values of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation indicators by about 0.07.

With the objective of providing tools for that purpose, this study assesses the potential of three textural image characterisation methods: radiomics, fractal dimension and the recently developed superpixel-based histon, as biomarkers to be used for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in order to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images. Models generated from three different AI algorithms have been studied: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. Two open-access image datasets were used in this study. In the first one, a dataset composed of paediatric chest X-ray, the best performing generated models achieved an 83.3% accuracy with 89% sensitivity for radiomics, 89.9% accuracy with 93.6% sensitivity for fractal dimension and 91.3% accuracy with 90.5% sensitivity for superpixels based histon. Second, a dataset derived from an image repository developed primarily as a tool for studying COVID-19 was used. For this dataset, the best performing generated models resulted in a 95.3% accuracy with 99.2% sensitivity for radiomics, 99% accuracy with 100% sensitivity for fractal dimension and 99% accuracy with 98.6% sensitivity for superpixel-based histons.

To this end, we evaluate the static fractal structures and the dynamic transport properties of various channel networks and, then, validate Liu's conjecture (1992) for the shape of hydrologic responses. In the context of random walks on fractal networks, the fractal dimensions of channel networks can directly connect the static structure to the dynamic transport properties of channel networks through Horton's law of drainage composition. It is observed that the peak coordinates of hydrologic responses would have a more intimate relation to the connectivity of channel networks than the conductivity of those. The characteristic times of hydrologic responses also tend to be related to the connectivity of channel networks. Thereby, the shape of hydrologic responses would be expected directly affected by the fractal dimension of channel networks in terms of their static structure, while interpreted a combined result of the conductivity and the connectivity of channel networks in terms of their dynamic transport properties. So, the runoff hydrographs of a river basin could be considered shaped by the fractal dimensions of its channel networks following the linear hydrologic system theory.","The author, Joo-Cheol Kim, faithfully thanks to Mrs. Hyouna Lim for her everlasting support.

To ensure a reliable evaluation, the AHP-EWM coupling evaluation model (analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method), which integrates the strengths of both evaluation models and minimizes the potential errors associated with a single model, was employed to assess the heterogeneity index of coal reservoirs in the Panguan syncline. According to the findings of the AHP-EWM model, it was observed that the comprehensive index of coal heterogeneity consistently increases as the degree of coal deformation increases. Notably, a critical value of I = 0.48 was identified as the threshold for the comprehensive index of brittle and ductile deformation coal heterogeneity. Furthermore, the pore-fracture characteristic was determined to have the greatest effect on the heterogeneity of coal reservoirs, followed by the metamorphic degree.

The pore structure of coal samples before and after the adsorption and desorption tests was tested by combining the mercury pressure test and the low-temperature liquid nitrogen adsorption test, and the influence of the change in the pore structure of coal samples after the high-temperature and high-pressure adsorption and desorption tests on the hysteresis effect of methane desorption was studied. The results showed that under the same pressure, the pore volume of coal samples increased with the increase in temperature, the pore-specific surface area showed a tendency to decrease, and the fractal dimension could well characterize the relationship between the pore structure and the pore surface of coal, in which the fractal dimension of the pores in the large pore size section gradually increased with the increase of temperature, and the fractal dimension in the small pore size section gradually decreased; there was a good correlation between the pore structure of the coal samples after the high-temperature and high-pressure adsorption and desorption tests and the hysteresis coefficient of desorption. The structural characteristics of the coal samples after adsorption and desorption hysteresis coefficient at high temperature and high pressure showed good correlation, i.e., the pore volume, the fractal dimension of the large pore size section, and the desorption hysteresis effect were negatively correlated, while the specific surface area, the fractal dimension of the small pore size section, and the desorption hysteresis effect were positively correlated.",This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52074107).,,ACS Omega,,,,2024-01-07,2024,2024-01-07,,9,3,3709-3729,,,"Zhang, Yafei; Wang, Zhaofeng; Si, Shasha; Yue, Jiwei","Zhang, Yafei (School of Safety Science and Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China); Wang, Zhaofeng (School of Safety Science and Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China; The Ministry of Education Engineering Research Center for Coal Mine Disaster Prevention and Rescue, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China; The Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center for Coal Safety Production and Clean and Efficient Utilization, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China); Si, Shasha (School of Safety Science and Engineering, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China); Yue, Jiwei (School of Safety Science and Engineering, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232000, Anhui, China)","Wang, Zhaofeng (Henan Polytechnic University; The Ministry of Education Engineering Research Center for Coal Mine Disaster Prevention and Rescue, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China; The Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center for Coal Safety Production and Clean and Efficient Utilization, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China)","Zhang, Yafei (Henan Polytechnic University); Wang, Zhaofeng (Henan Polytechnic University; The Ministry of Education Engineering Research Center for Coal Mine Disaster Prevention and Rescue, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China; The Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center for Coal Safety Production and Clean and Efficient Utilization, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China); Si, Shasha (Henan Polytechnic University); Yue, Jiwei (Anhui University of Science and Technology)",0,0,,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.3c07528,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167763329,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

In this review paper, we present a self-contained and comprehensive introduction to the fractal dimension. We collect and present various numerical estimators and focus on the three most promising ones: generalized entropy, correlation sum, and extreme value theory. We then perform an extensive quantitative evaluation of these estimators, comparing their performance and precision using different datasets and comparing the impact of features like length, noise, embedding dimension, and falsify-ability, among many others. Our analysis shows that for synthetic noiseless data, the correlation sum is the best estimator with extreme value theory following closely. For real experimental data, we found the correlation sum to be more strongly affected by noise vs the entropy and extreme value theory. The recent extreme value theory estimator seems powerful as it has some of the advantages of both alternative methods. However, using four different ways for checking for significance, we found that the method yielded ""significant"" low-dimensional results for inappropriate data like stock market timeseries. This fact, combined with some ambiguities we found in the literature of the method applications, has implications for both previous and future real-world applications using the extreme value theory approach, as, for example, the argument for small effective dimensionality in the data cannot come from the method itself.

However, in the case of insufficient samples, overcoming the task complexity while improving the accuracy is still a major challenge. To address this problem, this article considers the consistency between similar data from the fractal perspective, introduces a priori knowledge, and proposes a fractal embedding model by combining FSL with fractal dimension theory for the first time. We improve the original fractal dimension algorithm used to describe image texture roughness to suit a neural network. Moreover, in accordance with the improved algorithm, prior knowledge of the quantized image is integrated into the features to reduce the impact of the data distribution on the model. Experimental results obtained on multiple image benchmark datasets show that the performance of the proposed model exceeds or matches that of previous state-of-the-art models.

Fractal dimension (FD) is a widely employed method for measuring the complexity of shapes with many applications in neurodegenerative disorders. Nevertheless, very little is known on the fractal characteristics of EEG in PD measured by FD. In this study we performed a spatio-temporal analysis of EEG in PD using FD in four dimensions (4DFD). We analyzed 42 resting-state EEG recordings comprising two groups: 27 PD patients without dementia and 15 healthy control subjects (HC). From the original resting-state EEG we derived the cortical activations defined by a source reconstruction at each time sample, generating point clouds in three dimensions. Then, a sliding window of one second (the fourth dimension) was used to compute the value of 4DFD by means of the box-counting algorithm. Our results showed a significantly higher value of 4DFD in the PD group (p < 0.001). Moreover, as a diagnostic classifier of PD, 4DFD obtained an area under curve value of 0.97 for a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. These results suggest that 4DFD could be a promising method for characterizing the specific changes in the brain dynamics associated with PD.",,"This work is part of the research project PID2019-105145RB-I00 supported by the Spanish Government (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033).

However, when the flux of the subphase is high, the convective flow beneath the membrane also influences lipid movement. Lipid monolayers of an unsaturated fatty acid at the water-air interface serve as model membranes. The formation of domains in the liquid/condensed coexistence region is investigated. The dimension of the domains is fractal, and they grow with a constant growth velocity. Increasing the compression speed of the monolayer induces a transition from seaweed growth to dendritic growth. Seaweed domains have broad tips and wide and variable side branch spacing. In contrast, dendritic domains have a higher fractal dimension, narrower tips, and small, well-defined side branch spacing. Additionally, the growth velocity is markedly larger for dendritic than seaweed growth. The domains' growth velocity increases and the tip radius decreases with increasing supersaturation in the liquid/condensed coexistence region. Implications for membranes are discussed.","Cooperation within the CRC 1270 Elaine (SFB 1270/1,2–299150580) is gratefully acknowledged.","This research was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) in the Framework of the RTG 1947, grant number 231396381.",Membranes,,Lucia Sessa,,2022-07-08,2022,2022-07-08,,12,7,698,,,"Gellert, Florian; Ahrens, Heiko; Wulff, Harm; Helm, Christiane A","Gellert, Florian (Institute of Physics, University of Greifswald, Felix-Hausdorff-Straße 6, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.); Ahrens, Heiko (Institute of Physics, University of Greifswald, Felix-Hausdorff-Straße 6, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.); Wulff, Harm (Institute of Physics, University of Greifswald, Felix-Hausdorff-Straße 6, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.); Helm, Christiane A (Institute of Physics, University of Greifswald, Felix-Hausdorff-Straße 6, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.)","Helm, Christiane A (University of Greifswald)","Gellert, Florian (University of Greifswald); Ahrens, Heiko (University of Greifswald); Wulff, Harm (University of Greifswald); Helm, Christiane A (University of Greifswald)",4,4,0.32,1.0,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0375/12/7/698/pdf?version=1657277322,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149370322,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering,

Several studies have shown that excessive consumption of ethanol results in morphophysiological changes in the male reproductive system. One of the effects of ethanol is the decrease in testosterone concentration and hormonal therapies are an alternative to minimize the changes resulting from chronic alcoholism. Qualitative studies were commonly carried out to evaluate the male histopathological alterations resulting from ethanol consumption, being necessary quantitative and non-subjective techniques. This study analyzes the importance of fractal analysis as a useful tool to identify and quantify tissue remodeling in rats submitted to ethanol consumption and hormone therapy with testosterone. Prostate of animals submitted to chronic ethanol consumption showed tissue disorganization, which was confirmed by an increasing of fractal dimension. Regarding the prostatic stroma, collagen fractal dimension and quantification revealed lower values in animals that were only submitted to androgen therapy.

Traditional morphometric methods, focusing on one- or two-dimensional geometric levels, often fall short of accurately capturing the three-dimensional (3D) structure of organisms. The advent of 3D scanning techniques has revolutionized the study of organismal morphology, enabling comprehensive and accurate measurements. This study employs a 3D structured light scanning system to analyze the morphological variations in the Chinese toad (Bufo gargarizans Cantor, 1842) along the Yellow River Basin. The 3D digital model obtained from the scan was used to calculate various morphological parameters including body surface area, volume, fractal dimensions, and limb size. The research explores geographic variability patterns and identifies environmental drivers affecting the 3D phenotypic variation of B. gargarizans. Results reveal a bimodal pattern of variation in the toad population, with higher elevations exhibiting smaller body sizes, greater appendage proportions, and more complex body structures. Linear regression analyses highlight the influence of elevation and annual mean temperature on the morphological variation of B. gargarizans, with elevation playing a significant role.

Patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) internal derangement (ID) were divided into three groups according to how many times the arthrocentesis with HA injection was performed. FD analysis is a quantitative concept that provides information about trabecular bone microstructures. Regions of interest were selected from bone areas close to the articular surfaces of the right and left condyles on panoramic radiographs, which were taken before the procedure (T0) and at the sixth month (T1) after the procedure. Then, the FD values were calculated. All images were reviewed by the same researcher. A two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to determine whether there was a significant interaction between groups, treatment sides, and time on the FD values. A total of 140 patients, including 118 patients who received bilateral arthrocentesis with HA injection and 22 control patients, were included in the study. The images of 20 randomly selected patients were re-evaluated after 2 weeks. As a result of the correlation analysis, there was no significant difference between the two measurements (P > 0.05). The main effect of time on the FD value was significant [F (1, 136) = 157.879, P < 0.001]. This effect was qualified by a significant time × group interaction effect [F (3, 136) = 18.533, P < 0.001]. The increases in the mean FD values on the right and left sides in all treatment groups between T0 and T1 times were significant (P < 0.001 for all), whereas changes in FD values on the right and left sides between T0 and T1 times were not significant in the control group (P = 0.164 and P = 0.557, respectively). After arthrocentesis with HA injections, the mean FD values increased in the mandibular condyles, depending on time in all treatment groups. Patients with TMJ ID are likely to have radiologically detectable degenerative changes and abnormalities in the condyles. The FD analysis method, which provides quantitative data, is recommended as an adjunct and guide for oral and maxillofacial surgeons in radiological examinations that should be performed together with clinical examination for the follow-up of microstructural changes in the condyle after arthrocentesis with HA injection.",Declaration of competing interest The author declares that there is no conflict of interest and that the study received no support from the industry or other similar sources.,,Journal of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery,,,"Arthrocentesis; Fractals; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Injections, Intra-Articular; Mandibular Condyle; Retrospective Studies; Temporomandibular Joint; Temporomandibular Joint Disorders; Treatment Outcome",2022-07-08,2022,2022-07-08,2022-08,50,8,643-650,,,"Memiş, Sadi","Memiş, Sadi (Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dentistry, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey.

The fractal dendrite electrodeposition behavior of quasi-two-dimensional Cu (Q2D-Cu) metal based on the wire is examined via direct electrodeposition using a thin layer reactor. Here, to explain the fractal growth mechanism, the directional migration and random walking of ions are introduced in the traditional diffusion-limited aggregation model, and fractal patterns consistent with the experimental results are successfully simulated. In addition, the Cu fractal dendrite structure is finely adjusted by varying electrodeposition conditions, demonstrating its great potential for further optimization. The CuO/Q2D-Cu fractal dendrite photothermal device fabricated through in situ assembly of CuO nanowires on Cu fractal dendrite has good photothermal conversion ability. Therefore, metal fractal dendrites, which are considered harmful in the electroplating industry, have application prospects in the photothermal field.","This work was supported by the Applied Basic Research Project of Sichuan Province (2018JY0062), Chengdu Science and Technology Benefit to the People Research and Development Project (2015-HM01-00385-SF), Research Initiated Project of Chengdu University (2081921027), and Research Initiated Project of Chengdu University (2081921109).",,Langmuir,,,,2023-02-15,2023,2023-02-15,2023-02-28,39,8,3045-3051,,,"Yang, Yuxin; Zeng, Haoyue; Wang, Daiyi; Wu, Yujian; Chen, Jiaqi; Huang, Yanyan; Wang, Pan; Feng, Wei","Yang, Yuxin (School of Mechanical Engineering, Chengdu University, Chengdu, 610000, PR China); Zeng, Haoyue (School of Mechanical Engineering, Chengdu University, Chengdu, 610000, PR China); Wang, Daiyi (School of Mechanical Engineering, Chengdu University, Chengdu, 610000, PR China); Wu, Yujian (School of Mechanical Engineering, Chengdu University, Chengdu, 610000, PR China); Chen, Jiaqi (School of Mechanical Engineering, Chengdu University, Chengdu, 610000, PR China); Huang, Yanyan (School of Mechanical Engineering, Chengdu University, Chengdu, 610000, PR China); Wang, Pan (School of Mechanical Engineering, Chengdu University, Chengdu, 610000, PR China); Feng, Wei (School of Mechanical Engineering, Chengdu University, Chengdu, 610000, PR China)","Yang, Yuxin (Chengdu University); Feng, Wei (Chengdu University)","Yang, Yuxin (Chengdu University); Zeng, Haoyue (Chengdu University); Wang, Daiyi (Chengdu University); Wu, Yujian (Chengdu University); Chen, Jiaqi (Chengdu University); Huang, Yanyan (Chengdu University); Wang, Pan (Chengdu University); Feng, Wei (Chengdu University)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155393992,40 Engineering; 4018 Nanotechnology,

Our model is based on the concepts of “product-like fractal measure” introduced to model dynamics in porous media and “complex fractional transform” which converts a fractal space on a small scale to a smooth space with a large scale. The solution of the fractal foam drainage equation has been approximated using the He’s homotopy perturbation method. Qualitative analysis shows that the behavior of the solitonic wave in fractal dimensions differ from the behavior in integer dimensions.

In this paper, nanosilica (NS), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), and graphene oxide (GO) were used to modify cement and optimize the pore structure. Uniaxial compression tests, X-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and combined fractal theory were used to analyze the mechanics and pore characteristics. The results show that the synergy of the three nanomaterials promotes the generation of hydration products such as calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and ettringite (AFt), improves the total pore fractal dimension (D w) and seepage pore fractal dimension (D s), and optimizes the microscopic pore structure. However, when the content of NS increases from 2 to 4 wt %, the improvement in the mechanical properties is obviously weakened. The best ratio is where the SiO2 content is 2 wt %, the MWCNT content is 0.1 wt %, and the GO content is 0.03 wt %. Compared with pure cement, the fractal dimension increases significantly, the mechanical properties are increased by 24.7%, and the total porosity is reduced by 23.9%.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for an evaluation method to evaluate the service reliability of highway tunnels, so as to provide reference for tunnel maintenance personnel to carry out maintenance work. Taking highway tunnels as the research object, this paper extracts three parameters, including length, maximum width and fractal dimension, from the binary image of highway tunnel lining cracks. The standard for dividing the length of the highway tunnel section is 500m as the tunnel section, and a section disease sample space including multiple highway tunnels is constructed. The EM clustering algorithm was used to determine the number of graded grades of disease, and the relative Euclidean distance was used as the evaluation index to divide the safety grade of the tunnel into five grades: normal, degraded, inferior, deteriorated and hazardous. The partial least squares method is used to establish the lining service reliability evaluation formula and verify the residual of each sample point in the sample space. The smaller the average value of the residual, the better fitting effect of the established evaluation formula. The service reliability evaluation method proposed in this paper is applied to engineering practice and compared with the expert scoring method and the national standard method, which proves that the evaluation method in this paper has the advantages of strong visibility, simple evaluation method, and is conducive to engineering practice.",,The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,PLOS ONE,,Jianguo Wang,"Reproducibility of Results; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Algorithms; China; Fractals",2023-08-11,2023,2023-08-11,,18,8,e0288633,,,"Dai, Chunquan; Zhou, Zhaochen; Zhang, Huidi; Jiang, Kun; Li, Haisheng; Yu, Haiyang","Dai, Chunquan (Shandong Civil Engineering Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Laboratory, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China); Zhou, Zhaochen (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China); Zhang, Huidi (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China); Jiang, Kun (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China); Li, Haisheng (Research and Development Department, Ronghua Construction Group Limited, Qingdao, China); Yu, Haiyang (Research and Development Department, Ronghua Construction Group Limited, Qingdao, China)","Dai, Chunquan (Shandong University of Science and Technology)","Dai, Chunquan (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Zhou, Zhaochen (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Zhang, Huidi (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Jiang, Kun (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Li, Haisheng (Research and Development Department, Ronghua Construction Group Limited, Qingdao, China); Yu, Haiyang (Research and Development Department, Ronghua Construction Group Limited, Qingdao, China)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0288633&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163231068,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Through a self-developed simulation experiment of water-borne coal particle migration and accumulation and computer graphics, we investigated the influencing factors of particle accumulation in water injection and their influence law on seepage, discussed the interaction relationship between the fractal structure of coal and the characteristics of accumulated coal particles, and established a new fractal model of fracture permeability based on different particle accumulation states. The results show that the seepage velocity and the particle size jointly affect the migration and accumulation process of water-borne coal particles. When the coal particle size is constant and the seepage velocity increases, then the output of the coal powder increases, the deposition decreases, and the structure fractal dimension D3 of fractures decreases. At the same seepage velocity, with the increase of the coal particle size, the output of coal powder decreases, the deposition increases, and the structure fractal dimension D3 of fractures increases. In addition, the amount of coal powder produced in the intermittent water injection process is smaller than that produced in the continuous water injection process, more easily leading to accumulation. The variation law of the theoretical permeability with porosity remains consistent for different particle accumulation states: with the increase of porosity, the structure fractal dimension D3 of fractures decreases, while the theoretical permeability increases. The above research results can provide a theoretical basis for reducing the seepage damage of coal under the particle blocking effect.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52274213, 52074173, 51934004), Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2022YQ52, ZR2023QE132), and Taishan Scholars Project Special Funding.","National Natural Science Foundation of China (52274213, 52074173, 51934004), Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2022YQ52, ZR2023QE132), and Taishan Scholars Project Special Funding.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Fractals; Coal; Powders; Computer Simulation; Water,2023-10-19,2023,2023-10-19,2023-11,30,53,113917-113931,,,"Yang, He; Liu, Zhen; Yu, Zehan; Li, Raorao; Wang, Shuangyue","Yang, He (College of Safety and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 579 Qianwangang Rd, 266590, Qingdao, Huangdao District, People’s Republic of China; State Key Laboratory of Mining Disaster Prevention and Control Co-Founded By Shandong Province and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, People’s Republic of China); Liu, Zhen (College of Safety and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 579 Qianwangang Rd, 266590, Qingdao, Huangdao District, People’s Republic of China; State Key Laboratory of Mining Disaster Prevention and Control Co-Founded By Shandong Province and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, People’s Republic of China); Yu, Zehan (College of Safety and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 579 Qianwangang Rd, 266590, Qingdao, Huangdao District, People’s Republic of China; State Key Laboratory of Mining Disaster Prevention and Control Co-Founded By Shandong Province and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, People’s Republic of China); Li, Raorao (College of Safety and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 579 Qianwangang Rd, 266590, Qingdao, Huangdao District, People’s Republic of China; State Key Laboratory of Mining Disaster Prevention and Control Co-Founded By Shandong Province and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, People’s Republic of China); Wang, Shuangyue (College of Safety and Environmental Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 579 Qianwangang Rd, 266590, Qingdao, Huangdao District, People’s Republic of China; State Key Laboratory of Mining Disaster Prevention and Control Co-Founded By Shandong Province and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, People’s Republic of China)","Liu, Zhen (Shandong University of Science and Technology; Shandong University of Science and Technology)","Yang, He (Shandong University of Science and Technology; Shandong University of Science and Technology); Liu, Zhen (Shandong University of Science and Technology; Shandong University of Science and Technology); Yu, Zehan (Shandong University of Science and Technology; Shandong University of Science and Technology); Li, Raorao (Shandong University of Science and Technology; Shandong University of Science and Technology); Wang, Shuangyue (Shandong University of Science and Technology; Shandong University of Science and Technology)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165062132,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

The research question was whether FD could serve as an accessory tool to refer postmenopausal women for densitometric analysis. Therefore, the reliability and accuracy of FD were evaluated.
Materials and Methods: In total, 103 postmenopausal women were evaluated, of whom 52 had normal bone mineral density and 51 had osteoporosis, according to dual X-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and hip. On the CBCT scans, 2 regions of interest were selected for FD analysis: 1 at the second cervical vertebra and 1 located at the mandible. The correlations between both measurements, intra- and inter-observer agreement, and the accuracy of the measurements were calculated. A P value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance for all tests.
Results: The mean FD values were significantly lower at the mandibular region of interest in osteoporotic patients than in individuals with normal bone mineral density. The areas under the curve were 0.644 (P=0.008) and 0.531 (P=0.720) for the mandibular and vertebral sites, respectively.
Conclusion: FD at the vertebral site could not be used as an adjuvant tool to refer women for osteoporosis investigation.

At first, four initial damage levels were achieved by applying different impact loads to the intact rock, and the damage stresses for levels I, II, III, and IV initial damage were 9.80 Mpa, 17.00 Mpa, 23.34 Mpa, and 32.54 Mpa, respectively. Then dynamic compression tests were conducted on the muddy siltstones containing initial damage after 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 F-T cycles in the temperature range from -20 to 20 °C. The damage variable of the muddy siltstones was determined by studying energy distribution during fracture of the rock. The damage evolution characteristics of the muddy siltstone containing initial damage under the F-T effect were explored combined with the fractal theory. Test results show that (1) the dynamic compressive strength of the muddy siltstones decreases exponentially with the increasing number of F-T cycles; the dynamic compressive strength of muddy siltstone with different initial damage decreased by 54.9%, 48.4%, 39.4%, 42.5%, and 44.5% after 40 freeze-thaws, respectively, compared with that of intact. (2) The absorbed energy, reflected energy, and transmitted energy of the muddy siltstones subject to different levels of initial damage exhibit step-like changes under the effect of F-T cycles and the rate of decrease in absorbed energy decreases in the late stage of F-T cycles. (3) Both the damage variable and the fractal dimension of the muddy siltstones show an increasing trend with an increase in the number of F-T cycles, and it is more difficult for damage to become superimposed as the damage accumulates to that range causing fatigue (the damage variables ranged from 0.73 to 0.97) while the fractal dimension of the fracture surfaces in the rock still increases. (4) With the gradual increase in the damage variable, the energy absorption density of the rock is negatively correlated with the fractal dimension of the rock fragments.",,This research was funded by “The Key Basic Research Project of Hebei Province” (grant no.223754403D).,Materials,,,,2022-12-22,2022,2022-12-22,,16,1,120,,,"Jia, Yufei; Bai, Yuxin; Xia, Dong; Li, Fuping; Liang, Bing","Jia, Yufei (College of Mining Engineering, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China); Bai, Yuxin (College of Mining Engineering, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China); Xia, Dong (College of Mining Engineering, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China; Hebei Province Mining Industry Development with Safe Technology Priority Laboratory, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China; Hebei Industrial Technology Institute of Mine Ecological Remediation, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China); Li, Fuping (College of Mining Engineering, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China; Hebei Province Mining Industry Development with Safe Technology Priority Laboratory, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China; Hebei Industrial Technology Institute of Mine Ecological Remediation, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China); Liang, Bing (College of Mining Engineering, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China; Hebei Province Mining Industry Development with Safe Technology Priority Laboratory, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China; Hebei Industrial Technology Institute of Mine Ecological Remediation, North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China)","Xia, Dong (North China University of Science and Technology; North China University of Science and Technology; North China University of Science and Technology)","Jia, Yufei (North China University of Science and Technology); Bai, Yuxin (North China University of Science and Technology); Xia, Dong (North China University of Science and Technology; North China University of Science and Technology; North China University of Science and Technology); Li, Fuping (North China University of Science and Technology; North China University of Science and Technology; North China University of Science and Technology); Liang, Bing (North China University of Science and Technology; North China University of Science and Technology; North China University of Science and Technology)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/1/120/pdf?version=1672210493,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153951263,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Efficient drug delivery systems must overcome multiple barriers and maximize drug delivery to the target tumors, simultaneously limiting side effects. Since the first observation of the quantum tunneling phenomenon, many multidisciplinary studies have offered quantum-inspired solutions to optimized tumor mapping and efficient nanodrug design. The property of a wave function to propagate through a potential barrier offer the capability of obtaining 3D surface profiles using imaging of individual atoms on the surface of a material. The application of quantum tunneling on a scanning tunneling microscope offers an exact surface roughness mapping of tumors and pharmaceutical particles. Critical elements to cancer nanotherapeutics apply the fractal theory and calculate the fractal dimension for efficient tumor surface imaging at the atomic level. This review study presents the latest biological approaches to cancer management based on fractal geometry.","Authors gratefully acknowledge technical and financial support from Ministry of Education and Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",,Current Medicinal Chemistry,,,Humans;

Within these soft, living materials, called pellicles, constituent cells gain group-level survival advantages including increased antibiotic resistance. However, the regulatory and structural components that drive pellicle self-patterning are not well defined. Here, using Vibrio cholerae as our model system, we report that two sets of matrix proteins and a key quorum-sensing regulator jointly orchestrate the sequential mechanical instabilities underlying pellicle morphogenesis, culminating in fractal patterning. A pair of matrix proteins, RbmC and Bap1, maintain pellicle localization at the interface and prevent self-peeling. A single matrix protein, RbmA, drives a morphogenesis program marked by a cascade of ever finer wrinkles with fractal scaling in wavelength. Artificial expression of rbmA restores fractal wrinkling to a ΔrbmA mutant and enables precise tuning of fractal dimensions. The quorum-sensing regulatory small RNAs Qrr1-4 first activate matrix synthesis to launch pellicle primary wrinkling and ridge instabilities. Subsequently, via a distinct mechanism, Qrr1-4 suppress fractal wrinkling to promote fine modulation of pellicle morphology. Our results connect cell-cell signaling and architectural components to morphogenic patterning and suggest that manipulation of quorum-sensing regulators or synthetic control of rbmA expression could underpin strategies to engineer soft biomaterial morphologies on demand.","We thank Ameya M.

The Population Balance Equation (PBE) flocculation model is designed to predict the time-dependent floc size distribution and should be more complete than models based on median floc size. However, a PBE flocculation model includes many empirical parameters to represent important physical, chemical, and biological processes. We report a systematic investigation of key model parameters of the open-source PBE-based size class flocculation model FLOCMOD (Verney, Lafite, Claude Brun-Cottan and Le Hir, 2011) using the measured temporal floc size statistics reported by Keyvani and Strom (2014) at a constant turbulent shear rate S. Results show that the median floc size d50, in terms of both the equilibrium floc size and the initial floc growth, is insufficient to constrain the model parameters. A comprehensive error analysis shows that the model is capable of predicting three floc size statistics d16, d50 and d84, which also reveals a clear trend that the best calibrated fragmentation rate (inverse of floc yield strength) is proportional to the floc size statistics considered. Motivated by this finding, the importance of floc yield strength is demonstrated in the predicted temporal evolution of floc size by modeling the floc yield strength as microflocs and macroflocs giving two corresponding fragmentation rates. The model shows a significantly improved agreement in matching the measured floc size statistics.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper Acknowledgment This research was made possible by grants from National Science Foundation (OCE-1924532, OCE1924655).

Previously, fractal dimension (FD) analysis values of mandibular cortical bone were shown to be lower in osteoporosis. Therefore, FD might be considered as an auxiliary tool to refer patients for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is the gold standard for BMD measurement. The purpose of this cross-sectional retrospective study was to evaluate trabecular and cortical microarchitecture of the mandible with FD analysis on panoramic radiographs in a subpopulation of FMF. Also, the effect of colchicine use was investigated. Forty-three FMF patients, aged between 10.8 and 71.2 years, and age- and gender-matched control group consisting of patients, who had no systemic diseases, were included. Demographic information such as age and gender, and colchicine use were recorded. In terms of age, the patients were classified as <30 and 30< years. On each panoramic radiographs five regions of interest were selected on the mandible as: 1- premolar, 2- molar, 3- angular, 4- condylar, and 5- basal cortical bone regions on right (R) and left (L) sides. Statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05 level. Intra- and inter-observer agreements demonstrated good to excellent consistency. In FMF patients, L3 and L4 values were higher, whereas L5 values were lower (p<0.05) than the control group. In terms of age, the difference between groups was insignificant in FMF patients (p>0.05), whereas in control group R3 and L4 values were higher in the 30< age group (p<0.05). Regarding gender and colchicine use, the difference between groups was insignificant (p>0.05). FMF disease might be a candidate for referral to DXA examination based on decreased bone density in the mandibular cortex detected by FD measurements on routine panoramic radiographs. Further studies are warranted to ascertain this relationship.",,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Ewa Tomaszewska,Humans; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Aged; Aged; Familial Mediterranean Fever; Retrospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fractals; Colchicine,2023-06-30,2023,2023-06-30,,18,6,e0288170,,,"Ersan, Nilüfer; Özel, Beliz","Ersan, Nilüfer (Yeditepe University Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Dentomaxillofacial Radiology, Istanbul, Turkiye); Özel, Beliz (Yeditepe University Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Endodontics, Istanbul, Turkiye)","Ersan, Nilüfer (Yeditepe University)","Ersan, Nilüfer (Yeditepe University); Özel, Beliz (Yeditepe University)",2,2,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0288170&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160281846,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

However, relation between retinal vascular abnormalities and brain structure is not well examined in schizophrenia. Hence in this study, for the first time, we examined the relationship between retinal vascular measures and brain white matter lesions in schizophrenia. We examined brain white matter lesions as they are considered a predictive marker for future adverse cerebrovascular event.
METHODS: We acquired retinal vascular images of both eyes using a non-mydriatic camera and calculated retinal vascular diameter, tortuosity, trajectory and fractal dimension using validated methods. All patients underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging of bran and we computed white matter hypo-intensities using Freesurfer software. We performed a linear regression analysis to examine the relationship between white matter hypo-intensities and retinal vascular measures controlling for age, sex, fasting blood sugar, creatinine, whole-brain volume, and antipsychotic dose.
RESULTS: The regression model was significant in Schizophrenia patients (R=0.983;R2 =0.966;-F=10.849;p = 0.008) but not in healthy volunteers (R=0.828;R2 =0.686;F=0.182; p = 0.963). Among the retinal vascular measures, arterial tortuosity (β = 0.963;p-0.002), tortuosity (β = -1.002;p = 0.001) and fractal dimension (β = -0.688;p = 0.014) were significant predictors of white matter lesions.
DISCUSSION: The current study's findings support the conclusion that retinal vascular fractal dimension and tortuosity are associated with changes in cerebral white matter and may be considered proxy markers for cerebral microvasculature in schizophrenia. Considering the relationship between white matter lesions and stroke, these observations could have important clinical implications to screen schizophrenia patients for risk of adverse cerebrovascular event.",None.,"Funding source: Department of Science and Technology, Government of India - (PI- Dr. Naren P Rao; IFA/12/LSBM/36; SR/CSRI/138/2015; SR/SATYAM/304/2015).

In this paper, a novel pore-scale model based on the equilateral triangle representative unit cell (RUC) and capillary bundle model is developed for the fluid flow through the anisotropic fibrous porous material according to fractal theory, and the effective through-plane permeability is presented accordingly. The digital structures of the fibrous porous material are generated by a fractal stochastic method (FSM), and the single-phase fluid flow through the 3D-reconstructed model is simulated by using the finite element method (FEM). It was found that the effective through-plane permeability depends on the fiber column size, porosity, and fractal dimensions for pore and tortuosity. The results show that the predicted through-plane permeability by the present fractal model indicates good agreement with numerical results and available experimental data as well as empirical formulas. The dimensionless through-plane permeability is positively correlated with the porosity and negatively correlated with the fractal dimensions for pore and tortuosity at certain porosity.",,"This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 51876196, 21873087), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers LR19E060001), the Science and technology innovation leading talent project of special support plan for high-level talents of Zhejiang Province (2021R52056), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang (grant number 2020YW13).",Materials,,,,2022-11-15,2022,2022-11-15,,15,22,8064,,,"Xu, Yao; Xu, Lianlian; Qiu, Shuxia; Jiang, Zhouting; Rao, Binqi; Xu, Peng","Xu, Yao (College of Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou 310018, China); Xu, Lianlian (College of Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou 310018, China); Qiu, Shuxia (College of Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou 310018, China); Jiang, Zhouting (College of Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou 310018, China); Rao, Binqi (College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou 310018, China); Xu, Peng (College of Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou 310018, China)","Xu, Peng (China Jiliang University)","Xu, Yao (China Jiliang University); Xu, Lianlian (China Jiliang University); Qiu, Shuxia (China Jiliang University); Jiang, Zhouting (China Jiliang University); Rao, Binqi (China Jiliang University); Xu, Peng (China Jiliang University)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/22/8064/pdf?version=1668505089,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152811757,40 Engineering,

Possible implant surface modifications include anodization or the plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) treatment process that produces a thick and dense oxide coating superior to normal anodic oxidation. Experimental modifications with Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) titanium and titanium alloy Ti6Al4V plates and PEO additionally treated with low-pressure oxygen plasma (PEO-S) were used in this study to evaluate their physical and chemical properties. Cytotoxicity of experimental titanium samples as well as cell adhesion to their surface were assessed using normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) or L929 cell line. Moreover, the surface roughness, fractal dimension analysis, and texture analysis were calculated. Samples after surface treatment have substantially improved properties compared to the reference SLA (sandblasted and acid-etched) surface. The surface roughness (Sa) was 0.59-2.38 µm, and none of the tested surfaces had cytotoxic effect on NHDF and L929 cell lines. A greater cell growth of NHDF was observed on the tested PEO and PEO-S samples compared to reference SLA sample titanium.",Authors would like to thank Anna Trzcionka Szajna and Ernest Szajna for preparing and delivering titanium samples for testing.,"This research was supported by the Wrocław Medical University Statutory Grant no.

Materials and Methods: In total, 116 cone-beam computed tomography scans of healthy individuals of different ages (57 men and 59 women, aged between 20 and 60 years) were selected. The following bone parameters were measured: 1) buccal, lingual, and basal cortical bone thickness in 5 standard parasagittal sections (the midline, the left and right sides of the lower lateral incisors, and the left and right sides of the lower canines); 2) the bone volume fraction of 10 sequential axial sections from each patient by creating a volume of interest in the area between the lower canines; and 3) fractal dimension and lacunarity using grayscale images of the same region of the volume of interest in the anterior mandible. Spearman correlation coefficients and the Mann-Whitney test were used.
Results: A significant and positive correlation was found between age and cortical thickness, especially in the region of the central incisors. Significant differences between sexes in terms of fractal dimension, lacunarity, and bone volume were found. Women revealed lower fractal dimension values and higher lacunarity and bone volume ratio values than men.

Although some sound achievements have been made regarding the pyrolysis of immature shale, the effect of the total organic carbon (TOC) content on the pore structure evolution of immature shale remains unclear. With respect to this issue, in this work, a series of N2 adsorption/desorption and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were conducted, and fractal dimension theory was also introduced to analyze the pore structure evolution of immature shale subjected to heating treatment in a quantitative manner. The results indicate that the adsorption branch of the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm can be divided into three stages. The pore structure of different TOC immature shales does not change significantly, and they are all slit-shaped. In addition, immature shale with a higher organic content has a higher hydrocarbon expulsion strength and a higher pore volume growth rate, which indicate that the pyrolysis of organic matter greatly affects the pore structure of immature shale during heating. This phenomenon shows that the pyrolysis of organic matter greatly influences the pore structure of immature shale during the heating process. The pores of immature shale in the study area have significant fractal characteristics, the fractal dimension is between 2.397 and 2.636, the pore space of the sample is extremely small, the pore structure is extremely complex, and the heterogeneity is strong.",This study was financially supported by the Project from Daqing Oilfield Co.

However, it is demanding to examine this intriguing problem experimentally, because one cannot prepare a series of samples based on the same material with systematically varying and noninteger dimensions. This problem is solved by considering the fractal dimensions of samples. The electronic structures of a series of powder samples of the high-TC superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-δ with the fractal dimensions (Df) of 2.5-3.0 were investigated using the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra at 293 K, to determine a general and quantitative relationship between the electronic properties and fractal dimensions of the samples. The observed Df-dependences of ESR parameters, such as g-values and linewidths, were quantitatively consistent with those of the critical temperatures, critical current densities, and lower critical magnetic fields, all of which exhibited anomalies at Df ∼ 2.9. Considering the geometrical features of the fractal models, a hypothesis for explaining the observed Df-dependences of the cooperative phenomena has been proposed, suggesting a universal structural instability at particular fractal dimensions, which affects all the physical and chemical properties of the samples.","We express our sincere thanks to Prof. Keishi Ohara at Ehime University, who kindly allowed us to use the ESR spectrometer in his laboratory.

In the experiments, two types of microparticles were used: first-plastic grains fully covered with metal, and second-Janus particles with a thin metal cap. We have tracked the trajectories of the separate grains and plotted the pair correlation functions of the observed structures. To examine the motion of the grains, we studied the dependencies of the MFPT dynamic entropy on the coarsening parameter, the fractal dimension of the system on its mean kinetic temperature, and the mean localization area of the grain on its mean kinetic temperature. Based on the obtained results, we conclude that the character of motion of our active Brownian systems changes as the power of an illuminating laser (and, therefore, the mean kinetic temperature of the grains) increases. Janus particles change their trajectories from more chaotic to spiral-like ones; in the case of fully covered particles, we observe the dynamical phase transition from the more ordered structure to the less ordered one.",,"The reported study was funded by RFBR, project number 20-32-90039.",Molecules,,Lev N.

The results show that: (1) Before the key seam fracture, the stress in the upper rock seam only changes in a small amount, and the stress in the lower rock seam evolves similarly to the single coal seam mining; when the key seam fracture is broken, the stress in the upper and lower rock seams will change by jumps. (2) The fractal dimension of the fissures rised from 1.4 to 1.5, the total area of fissures is increased from 16,638 pixels to 17,707 pixels, and the total length is increased from 2217 to 3071 pixels; after the main key layer of the overlying rock is broken, the fractal dimension of the fissures is reduced from 1.56 to 1.5, and the total area of fissures is reduced from 31,451 pixels to 29,089 pixels, the total length has increased from 5657 to 6619 pixels. (3) Before the key layer between the coal seams is broken, it will be suspended to form a ""fixed beam"". After the first break, the broken rock above it will settle synchronously until the rock blocks form a hinged structure and then collapse.

Therefore, preoperative prediction of TERTp mutation may assist in clinical decision making. However, no previous study has applied fractal analysis for TERTp mutation status prediction in meningiomas. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of three-dimensional (3D) fractal analysis for predicting the TERTp mutation status in grade 2 meningiomas.
METHODS: Forty-eight patients with surgically confirmed grade 2 meningiomas (41 TERTp-wildtype and 7 TERTp-mutant) were included. 3D fractal dimension (FD) and lacunarity values were extracted from the fractal analysis. A predictive model combining clinical, conventional, and fractal parameters was built using logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the ability of the model to predict TERTp mutation status.
RESULTS: Patients with TERTp-mutant grade 2 meningiomas were older (P = 0.029) and had higher 3D FD (P = 0.026) and lacunarity (P = 0.004) values than patients with TERTp-wildtype grade 2 meningiomas. On multivariable logistic analysis, higher 3D FD values (odds ratio = 32.50, P = 0.039) and higher 3D lacunarity values (odds ratio = 20.54, P = 0.014) were significant predictors of TERTp mutation status. The area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the multivariable model were 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.71-0.93), 83.3%, 71.4%, and 85.4%, respectively.

The association between TLS, early treatment initiation and longer survival highlights the need for deeper patient stratification that could lead to more targeted therapies. We hypothesized that such stratification might be achieved by using digital image analyses. Here we retrospectively analyzed 35 CRC patient samples classified as CLR or DII by digital analysis, focusing on the parameters Fractal dimension, Lacunarity and the textural features Angular second momentum, Correlation, Inverse difference momentum and Entropy. Significant differences in the grades of these parameters between the two patient groups provided preliminary data that additional biophysical information can divide CRC into at least 3 subgroups which encompass CLR and DII. Additional studies are needed to test if this sub-classification aids in the selection of targeted therapy for patients with CRC.","This work was supported in part by a supportive grant from the Ariel University Research Authority.

Features extracted from electroencephalography are most often averaged across individuals in a population with a particular condition and compared statistically to the mean of a typically developing group, or a group with a different condition, to define whether a feature is representative of the populations as a whole. However, there can be large variability within a population, and electroencephalography features often change dramatically with age, making comparisons difficult. Combined with often low numbers of trials and low signal-to-noise ratios in pediatric populations, establishing biomarkers can be difficult in practice. One approach is to identify electroencephalography features that are less variable between individuals and are relatively stable in a healthy population during development. To identify such features in resting-state electroencephalography, which can be readily measured in many populations, we introduce an innovative application of statistical measures of variance for the analysis of resting-state electroencephalography data. Using these statistical measures, we quantified electroencephalography features commonly used to measure brain development-including power, connectivity, phase-amplitude coupling, entropy, and fractal dimension-according to their intersubject variability. Results from 51 6-month-old infants revealed that the complexity measures, including fractal dimension and entropy, followed by connectivity were the least variable features across participants. This stability was found to be greatest in the right parietotemporal region for both complexity feature, but no significant region of interest was found for connectivity feature. This study deepens our understanding of physiological patterns of electroencephalography data in developing brains, provides an example of how statistical measures can be used to analyze variability in resting-state electroencephalography in a homogeneous group of healthy infants, contributes to the establishment of robust electroencephalography biomarkers of neurodevelopment through the application of variance analyses, and reveals that nonlinear measures may be most relevant biomarkers of neurodevelopment.",,"This work was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institute Heath Research (CIHR; Grant Number DCO150GP to SL), Kids Brain Health Network (KBHN) grant (to SL, LT), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC; Grant Number RGPIN-2019-05416 to LJT), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR; Grant Number MOP 153130G to LJT).

We employed the fatty acids (FA) composition and digital image analyses (DIA) to provide insights into the underlying processes and examine the possible weak SMF effects. Swiss-Webster male mice were whole-body exposed for 1 h/day over five days. Brain tissue's thin liquid chromatography resulted in brain FA composition, indicating a possible sequence of changes due to the SMF exposure. Quantitative DIA accurately assessed different image parameters. Delicate textural changes were revealed in the group where pathohistological or biochemical alterations have not been detected. DIA-based biological markers seem to be very promising for studying delicate tissue changes, which results from the high sensitivity and wide availability of DIA.","The authors acknowledge funding provided by the Institute of Physics Belgrade, the Faculty of Medicine, and the Institute for Medical Research, University of Belgrade, through the grants by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia.

In this study, we selected three low-rank coals and used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to visualize the macroscopic evolution of the pore structure of coal after heat treatment and to analyze the effect of temperature (25–500 °C) on the pore structure of coal, including porosity, permeability, and fractal dimensions. The obtained results show that the overall NMR signal in coal increases with increasing temperature, indicating that heat treatment can induce the enlargement, opening, and interconnection of pores and fractures in coal. The equivalent average pore radius (rm) of coal shows a positive correlation with temperature, with a substantial increase in rm, especially after temperatures above 200 °C. During heating, the porosity and permeability of all three coals tended to increase with temperature. At temperatures above 300 °C, the permeability of coal dramatically increases, predicting a higher fluid transport capacity. Furthermore, NMR multifractal theory was proposed for quantitative pore space dimensional characterization. The obtained results show that the fractal dimensions of the adsorption space of coal pores increase and then decrease with temperature during heating, while the fractal dimensions of percolation space are negatively correlated with temperature. In addition, the dimensions of adsorption space vary more strongly than those of percolation space, meaning that the adsorption capacity of low-rank coals is more significantly influenced by temperature.",,This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (51874313) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC0808101).,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Coal; Spontaneous Combustion; Temperature; Porosity; Adsorption,2023-01-05,2023,2023-01-05,2023-03,30,14,39932-39945,,,"Wang, Haiyan; Li, Jinglei; Zhang, Yanwei; Wu, Yaling; Wang, Zhuo","Wang, Haiyan (School of Emergency Management and Safety Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, 100083, Beijing, People’s Republic of China); Li, Jinglei (School of Emergency Management and Safety Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, 100083, Beijing, People’s Republic of China); Zhang, Yanwei (School of Emergency Management and Safety Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, 100083, Beijing, People’s Republic of China); Wu, Yaling (School of Emergency Management and Safety Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, 100083, Beijing, People’s Republic of China); Wang, Zhuo (School of Emergency Management and Safety Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, 100083, Beijing, People’s Republic of China)","Li, Jinglei (China University of Mining and Technology)","Wang, Haiyan (China University of Mining and Technology); Li, Jinglei (China University of Mining and Technology); Zhang, Yanwei (China University of Mining and Technology); Wu, Yaling (China University of Mining and Technology); Wang, Zhuo (China University of Mining and Technology)",5,5,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154256537,34 Chemical Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Implant topography and its nanostructural changes can be important for biomedical applications. In order to compare the surface topography of different implants, appropriate mathematical and physical descriptive methods should be provided. The aim of the study was to evaluate the experimental LIPSS-based-Low Spatial Frequency LIPSS (LSFL) dental implant surfaces. Novel methods of surface analysis, such as Fractal Dimension Analysis and Texture Analysis, were compared to the standard surface roughness evaluation. Secondary, cell viability, and attachment tests were applied in order to evaluate the biological properties of the new titanium surface and to compare their correlation with the physical properties of the new surfaces. A Normal Human Dermal Fibroblast (NHDF) cytotoxicity test did not show an impact on the vitality of the cells. Our study has shown that the laser LIPSS implant surface modifications significantly improved the cell adhesion to the tested surfaces. We observed a strong correlation of adhesion and the growth of cells on the tested surface, with an increase in implant surface roughness with the best results for the moderately rough (2 μm) surfaces.

A retrospective exploratory study in which 21 pairs of baseline and follow-up images of patients affected by DM were randomly chosen from the Sankara Nethralaya−Diabetic Retinopathy Study (SN DREAMS) I and II datasets. Patients’ fundus was photographed, and the diagnosis was made based on Klein classification. Vessel thickness parameters were generated using a web-based retinal vascular analysis platform called VASP. The thickness changes between the baseline and follow-up images were computed and normalized with the actual thicknesses of baseline images. The majority of parameters showed 10~20% changes over time. Vessel width in zone C for the second vein was significantly reduced from baseline to follow-up, which showed positive correlations with systolic blood pressure and serum high-density lipoproteins. Fractal dimension for all vessels in zones B and C and fractal dimension for vein in zones A, B and C showed a minimal increase from baseline to follow-up, which had a linear relationship with diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure, serum triglycerides (p < 0.05). Lacunarity for all vessels and veins in zones A, B and C showed a minimal decrease from baseline to follow-up which had a negative correlation with pulse pressure and positive correlation with serum triglycerides (p < 0.05). The vessel widths for the first and second arteries significantly increased from baseline to follow-up and had an association with high-density lipoproteins, glycated haemoglobin A1C, serum low-density lipoproteins and total serum cholesterol.

Here, we use theory and simulation to formulate such a connection by studying a fundamental topological property-the random knotting probability-for ring polymers with varying fractal dimension, d f . Using straightforward scaling arguments, we generalize a classic mathematical result, showing that the probability of a trivial knot decays exponentially with chain size, N, for all fractal dimensions: P 0(N) ∝ exp(-N/N 0). However, no such simple considerations can account for the dependence of the knotting length, N 0, on d f , necessitating a more involved analytical calculation. This analysis reveals a complicated double-exponential dependence, which is well supported by numerical data. By contrast, functional forms typical of simple scaling theories fail to adequately describe the observations. These findings are equally valid for two-dimensional ring polymer systems, where ""knotting"" is defined as the intersection of any two segments.","We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Artem M.

Methods: Standard 130-degree fundus photographs centered on the optic disc were taken in the newborns. The deep learning network provided segmentation of the retinal vessels and the optic disc (OD). Based on the vessel segmentation, the vascular morphological characteristics, including avascular area, vessel angle, vessel density, fractal dimension (FD), and tortuosity, were automatically evaluated.
Results: 201 eyes of FEVR, 289 eyes of ROP, and 195 eyes of healthy individuals were included in this study. The deep learning system of blood vessel segmentation had a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 99%. The vessel angle in the FEVR group was significantly smaller than that in the normal group and ROP group (37.43 ± 5.43 vs. 39.40 ± 5.61, 39.50 ± 5.58, P = 0.001, < 0.001 respectively). The normal group had the lowest vessel density, the ROP group was in between, and the FEVR group had the highest (2.64 ± 0.85, 2.97 ± 0.92, 3.37 ± 0.88 respectively). The FD was smaller in controls than in the FEVR and ROP groups (0.984 ± 0.039, 1.018 ± 0.039 and 1.016 ± 0.044 respectively, P < 0.001). The ROP group had the most tortuous vessels, while the FEVR group had the stiffest vessels, the controls were in the middle (11.61 ± 3.17, 8.37 ± 2.33 and 7.72 ± 1.57 respectively, P < 0.001).
Conclusions: The deep learning technology used in this study has good performance in the quantitative analysis of vascular morphological characteristics in fundus photography. Vascular morphology was different in the newborns of FEVR and ROP compared to healthy individuals, which showed great clinical value for the differential diagnosis of ROP and FEVR.",,This work was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LTGY23H120005).,Frontiers in Pediatrics,,,,2023-08-24,2023,2023-08-24,,11,,1252875,,,"Deng, Xinyi; Chen, Kun; Chen, Yijing; Xiang, Ziyi; Zhang, Shian; Shen, Lijun; Sun, Mingzhai; Cai, Lingzhi","Deng, Xinyi (Center for Rehabilitation Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital (Affiliated People’s Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College), Hangzhou, China); Chen, Kun (Department of Precision Machinery and Instrumentation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China); Chen, Yijing (Center for Rehabilitation Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital (Affiliated People’s Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College), Hangzhou, China); Xiang, Ziyi (Department of Retina Center, Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China); Zhang, Shian (Center for Rehabilitation Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital (Affiliated People’s Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College), Hangzhou, China); Shen, Lijun (Center for Rehabilitation Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital (Affiliated People’s Hospital, Hangzhou Medical College), Hangzhou, China); Sun, Mingzhai (Department of Precision Machinery and Instrumentation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China); Cai, Lingzhi (Affiliated Hangzhou First People’s Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China)","Sun, Mingzhai (University of Science and Technology of China); Cai, Lingzhi (Zhejiang University)","Deng, Xinyi (Hangzhou Medical College); Chen, Kun (University of Science and Technology of China); Chen, Yijing (Hangzhou Medical College); Xiang, Ziyi (Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College); Zhang, Shian (Hangzhou Medical College); Shen, Lijun (Hangzhou Medical College); Sun, Mingzhai (University of Science and Technology of China); Cai, Lingzhi (Zhejiang University)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2023.1252875/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163498028,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,

However, synthetic and biological macromolecules, in particular high molecular weight chains, can satisfy this size requirement without providing the same phenomena as one would expect from a nanoparticle. At the same time, soft polymer nanoparticles are important in a broad range of fields, including understanding protein folding, drug delivery, vitrimers, catalysis and nanomedicine. Moreover, the recent flourish of all polymer nanocomposites has led to the synthesis of soft all-polymer nanoparticles, which emerge from internal crosslinking of a macromolecule. Thus, there exists a transition of an internally crosslinked macromolecule from a polymer chain to a nanoparticle as the amount of internal crosslinks increases, where the polymer chain exhibits different behavior than the nanoparticle. Yet, this transition is not well understood. In this work, we seek to address this knowledge gap and determine the transition of a macromolecule from a polymer chain to a nanoparticle as internal crosslinking increases. In this work, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) offers insight into the structure of polystyrene and poly(ethyl hexyl methacrylate) nanostructures in dilute solutions, with crosslinking densities that vary from 0.1 to 10.7%. Analyses of the SANS data provides structural characteristics to classify a nanostructure as chain-like or particle-like and identify a crosslinking dependent transition between the two morphologies. It was found that for both types of polymeric nanostructures, a crosslinking density of 0.81% (∼ a crosslink for every 1 in 125 monomers) or higher exhibit clear particle-like behavior. Lower crosslinking density nanostructures showed amounts of collapse similar to that of a star polymer (0.1% XL) or a random walk polymer chain (0.4% XL). Thus, the transition of an internally crosslinked macromolecule from a polymer chain to a nanoparticle is not an abrupt transition but occurs via the gradual contraction of the chain with incorporated crosslinks.","This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division.

The macromolecular properties were analyzed by evaluating the intrinsic viscosity and coefficients of the translational diffusion and the sedimentation velocity of the lignins in dilute dimethylformamide solutions. The average molecular weights (MDη) and polydispersity parameters were calculated based on the results of the fractionation, as follows: Mw = 14.6 × 103, Mn = 9.0, and Mw/Mn = 1.62 for lignins from fir wood and Mw = 14.9 Mn = 13.5 and Mw/Mn = 1.1 for lignins from oat husks. The fractal analysis of the lignin macromolecules allowed us to identify the distinctive characteristics of the fractal and topological structures of these lignins. The measurements indicated that the fractal dimension (df) values of the guaiacyl-syringyl lignins from oat husks were between 1.71 and 1.85, while the df of a typical guaiacyl lignin from fir wood was ~2.3. Thus, we determined that the lignin macromolecules of oat husks belong to the diffusion-limited aggregation-type cluster-cluster class of fractals of the Meakin-Kolb type, with a predominance of characteristics common to a linear configuration. The lignins of softwood fir trees exhibited a branched topological structure, and they belong to the diffusion-limited aggregation-type particle-cluster class of fractals of the Witten-Sander type.

It depends on several parameters that represent its structure and state as well as their interactions, and therefore requires accurate assessment. For an effective evaluation of shear strength parameters of GGRS based on these factors and their interactions, three parameters, namely, moisture content, bulk density, and fractal dimension of grain size, were selected as influencing factors in this study based on a thorough investigation of the survey data and physical property tests of landslides in the study area. The individual effects and interaction of the factors were then incorporated by implementing a series of direct shear tests employing the response surface methodology (RSM) into the regression model of the shear parameters. The results indicate that the factors affecting shear parameters in the order of greater to lower are bulk density, moisture content, and fractal dimension, and their interactions are insignificant. The proposed model was validated by applying it to soil specimens from other landslide sites with the same parent bedrock, showing the validity of the strength regression model. This study demonstrates that RSM can be applied for parameter estimation of soils and provide reliable performance, and is also significant for conducting landslide investigation, evaluation, and regional risk assessment.","The authors would like to express special thanks to the 3rd Geological Department of Hubei Provincial Geological Bureau.

The change of characteristics in the microscopic pores of coal caused by the existence of water is an important factor affecting the diffusion and migration of gas in coal. The low-pressure nitrogen adsorption experiments and gas desorption experiments of a low-rank coal with different equilibrium moisture contents were conducted. The results show that both the specific surface area and pore volume decrease significantly as the moisture content increases, and the micropores (pore diameter <10 nm) are most affected by the water adsorbed by coal. In particular, for a water-equilibrated coal sample at 98% relative humidity, micropores with pore sizes smaller than 4 nm as determined by the density functional theory model almost disappear, probably due to the blocking effects of water clusters and capillary water. In this case, micropores with a diameter less than 10 nm still contribute most of the specific surface area for gas adsorption in coal. Furthermore, the fractal dimensions at relative pressures of 0-0.5 (D 1) and 0.5-1 (D 2) calculated by the Frenkel-Halsey-Hill model indicate that when the moisture content is less than 4.74%, D 1 decreases rapidly, whereas D 2 shows a slight reduction as the moisture content increased. In contrast, when the moisture content exceeds 4.74%, further increases in the moisture content cause D 2 to decrease significantly, while there is nearly no change for D 1. The correlation analyses show that the ultimate desorption volume and initial desorption rate are closely related to the fractal dimension D 1, while the desorption constant (K t) mainly depends on the fractal dimension D 2. Therefore, the gas desorption performances of coal have a close association with the pore properties of coal under water-containing conditions, which indicate that the fluctuation in moisture content should be carefully considered in the evaluation of gas diffusion and migration performances of in situ coal seams.","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51804201, 52174230, and 51904272), the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (Grant Nos.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of FD analysis in the osteogenesis detection of bone substitute materials (BSMs) of Bio-Oss in maxillary lateral sinus augmentation.
METHODS: Patients who received lateral maxillary sinus augmentation and underwent grafting with BSMs (Bio-Oss) were included in the study. The cross sections of the BSMs under cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) at mesial, distal, and sagittal directions were obtained immediately after the graft (T0) and 6 months later (T1), and the obtained images were cropped to include only the BSMs. The FD analysis was performed, and the FD value was obtained by the method of box-counting. Paired t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used, and p-values <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Twelve participants with 22 implants, which were inserted simultaneously after sinus augmentation, were included in this study. A total of 22 mesial, 22 distal, and 14 sagittal images were obtained after FD analysis. The mean FD value and standard deviation at T0 was 1.2860 ± 0.0896, while at T1, it was 1.2508±0.1023; thus, significant differences were detected (p = 0.022). However, the increasing or decreasing trend of FD value was not stable, and no significant difference was detected for FD values of mesial, distal, and sagittal images between T0 and T1. ANOVA indicated that no significant difference was detected among the FD values of mesial, distal, and sagittal images at any timepoint. Differences in FD values between the sexes were not significant either.
CONCLUSIONS: Since the FD analysis for the osteogenesis detection of BSMs in maxillary sinus augmentation indicated unstable trends of change, its feasibility is not reliable. The initially rough surface, self-degradation, and volume change of the BSMs during osteogenesis may be the reason for the variation in FD values.","We extend gratitude to our loved ones for their unwavering support throughout the completion of this study.

This paper attempts to reveal the friction adaptive mechanism. Based on the fractal theory, two fractal parameters of fractal dimension and scale coefficient are used to characterize the surface morphology of the slipper mathematically, and the adaptive friction mechanism model is established by combining the friction coefficient equation. The effects of different fractal parameters on the friction coefficient and other performance parameters of slipper pairs are obtained by means of the numerical analysis method. The wear test was carried out by replacing specimens at different intervals to observe the worn surface morphology and the degradation process of the slipper to verify the correctness of the theoretical results. The results show that the friction performance and load-bearing capabilities of the slipper can be recovered to a certain extent within a short period when early wear occurs, and its surface performance shows the variation characteristics of deterioration-repair-re-deterioration-re-repair.",,"This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 52275069, 52275067 and 52175065), the Hebei Natural Science Foundation, China (Grant Nos.

The influence of grinding time and particle group of CGS on the strength activity index of mortar was studied by using the strength activity index of mortar and grey correlation analysis. The results show that the particles are gradually refined before mechanical grinding of CGS for 75 min. When the mechanical grinding time is greater than 75 min, the ""agglomeration phenomenon"" of fine CGS particles led to the decrease in various properties. Divas-Aliavden grinding kinetics, the RRB model and fractal dimension can characterize the change of CGS particle size in the grinding process quantitatively. The strength activity index of CGS at different curing ages is positively correlated with grinding time, and the influence on the later strength activity index is the most obvious. The relationship between CGS particle size distribution and strength activity index were probed using grey correlation analysis. The CGS particle groups with the particle size of 20~30 μm and 10~20 μm have the greatest impact on the early and late strength activity index, respectively. Therefore, the optimal grinding time of CGS as auxiliary cementing material is 75 min, considering factors, such as economy and performance, and the specific surface area (SSA) is 4.4874 m2·g-1.","Special thanks are given to editors and anonymous reviewers for their valuable assistance, comments and suggestions.","This research was supported by the Postdoctoral Research Foundation (Mining Engineering) of Xi’an University of Science and Technology: 2050922010; National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52074212, 51874229, 51674188), Shaanxi Innovative Talents Cultivate Program-New-star Plan of Science and Technology (No. 2018KJXX-083), Scientific Research Program funded by the Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (Nos. 19JK0543), and Scientific Research Project of Youth Innovation Team Construction of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education (No. 21JP077).",Materials,,Miguel Ángel Sanjuán,,2022-09-01,2022,2022-09-01,,15,17,6033,,,"Zhu, Mengbo; Xie, Geng; Liu, Lang; Yang, Pan; Qu, Huisheng; Zhang, Caixin","Zhu, Mengbo (College of Energy Engineering, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China; Research Center for Functional Backfill Technology in Mine, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China; Key Laboratory of Western Mines and Hazards Prevention, Ministry of Education of China, Xi’an 710054, China); Xie, Geng (College of Energy Engineering, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China; Research Center for Functional Backfill Technology in Mine, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China); Liu, Lang (College of Energy Engineering, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China; Research Center for Functional Backfill Technology in Mine, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China; Key Laboratory of Western Mines and Hazards Prevention, Ministry of Education of China, Xi’an 710054, China); Yang, Pan (College of Energy Engineering, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China; Research Center for Functional Backfill Technology in Mine, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China); Qu, Huisheng (College of Energy Engineering, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China; Research Center for Functional Backfill Technology in Mine, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China); Zhang, Caixin (College of Energy Engineering, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China; Research Center for Functional Backfill Technology in Mine, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, Xi’an 710054, China)","Liu, Lang (Xi'an University of Science and Technology; Xi'an University of Science and Technology; Key Laboratory of Western Mines and Hazards Prevention, Ministry of Education of China, Xi’an 710054, China)","Zhu, Mengbo (Xi'an University of Science and Technology; Xi'an University of Science and Technology; Key Laboratory of Western Mines and Hazards Prevention, Ministry of Education of China, Xi’an 710054, China); Xie, Geng (Xi'an University of Science and Technology; Xi'an University of Science and Technology); Liu, Lang (Xi'an University of Science and Technology; Xi'an University of Science and Technology; Key Laboratory of Western Mines and Hazards Prevention, Ministry of Education of China, Xi’an 710054, China); Yang, Pan (Xi'an University of Science and Technology; Xi'an University of Science and Technology); Qu, Huisheng (Xi'an University of Science and Technology; Xi'an University of Science and Technology); Zhang, Caixin (Xi'an University of Science and Technology; Xi'an University of Science and Technology)",11,11,,5.59,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/17/6033/pdf?version=1662021418,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150713215,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

A total of 17 sandstone samples collected from the northwestern margin of the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang Province are investigated in this study. The pore-fracture system distribution of target sandstones is studied by high-pressure mercury injection tests. On this basis, single- and multi-fractal models are used to characterize pore structure heterogeneity, and the applicability of four models (Menger model, Sierpinski model, Thermodynamic model, multifractal model) to characterize pore and fracture distribution heterogeneity are discussed. Moreover, a correlation between fractal dimension, pore structure parameters, and variation coefficient of porosity-permeability is discussed based on overburden permeability test results. The results are as follows. (1) D S (fractal dimension of Sierpinski model) shows a significant correlation with pore volume percentage, so the Sierpinski model could better characterize fracture distribution heterogeneity quantitatively. Multifractal dimensions are consistent with those of Sierpinski and Thermodynamic models, which indicates that the single- and multiple-fractal models are consistent. (2) The porosity and permeability decrease as a power function with higher confining pressure. The porosity and permeability behavior changes at a critical conversion pressure value. For a confining pressure lower than this critical value, the porosity and permeability decrease largely. For confining pressures higher than this critical value, the porosity and permeability vary less. In contrast, permeability has a larger variation rate and is more obviously affected by confining pressure. (3) Pore compression space is affected by the permeability variation coefficient. Compressibility, porosity, and permeability variation coefficient have no relationship with pore structure parameters since compressibility is affected by pore structure, mineral composition, and other factors in sandstone samples.","This research was sponsored by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, China (ZR2021QD072, ZR2020QD040).",,ACS Omega,,,,2024-05-23,2024,2024-05-23,2024-06-04,9,22,23339-23354,,,"Yao, Peng; Zhang, Junjian; Qin, Zhenyuan; Fan, Aiping; Feng, Guangjun; Vandeginste, Veerle; Zhang, Pengfei; Zhang, Xiaoyang","Yao, Peng (College of Earth Sciences & Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266590, China); Zhang, Junjian (College of Earth Sciences & Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266590, China; School of Resources and Earth Science, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 221116, China); Qin, Zhenyuan (Department of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, United Kingdom); Fan, Aiping (College of Earth Sciences & Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266590, China); Feng, Guangjun (School of Resources and Earth Science, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, 221116, China); Vandeginste, Veerle (Department of Materials Engineering, KU Leuven, Campus Bruges, Bruges, 8200, Belgium); Zhang, Pengfei (College of Earth Sciences & Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266590, China); Zhang, Xiaoyang (College of Earth Sciences & Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266590, China)","Zhang, Junjian (Shandong University of Science and Technology; China University of Mining and Technology); Qin, Zhenyuan (University of Nottingham)","Yao, Peng (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Zhang, Junjian (Shandong University of Science and Technology; China University of Mining and Technology); Qin, Zhenyuan (University of Nottingham); Fan, Aiping (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Feng, Guangjun (China University of Mining and Technology); Vandeginste, Veerle (KU Leuven); Zhang, Pengfei (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Zhang, Xiaoyang (Shandong University of Science and Technology)",0,0,,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.3c09957,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171967856,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Structural properties such as the chains' contour length and their inner-monomer pair distribution function display fractal scaling properties as well. These predictions are confirmed with mesoscale numerical simulations. The chains are swollen and highly entangled, yet Flory's exponent is always ν = 1/2. The melt can be considered a fluid of ""blobs"" whose size becomes renormalized in terms of the contour's length while the fractal dimension df increases monotonically between 5/4 and 2, as the monomer concentration is increased. The semidilute scaling of the pressure is recovered when df = 1. Our results agree with recent experiments and with numerical reports on quasi-2d melts. This work provides a new paradigm to study and interpret thermodynamic and structural data in low-dimensional polymer melts, namely as fractal macromolecular objects.","This work was sponsored by CONAHCYT, through Grant No. 320197.

The results of the aggregation are consistent with previously published experimental work demonstrating multiple regimes of behavior based on the relative strength of shear and capillary forces. In previous work, densification of aggregates at low shear rates was theorized to occur due to short time scale fragmentation/reaggregation of aggregates with rigid particle bonds. In simulations, densification is observed at low shear rates but occurs due to local reorganization of particles due to capillary torques over long time scales. Moderate shear rates create mobile bonds between particles at shorter time scales, allowing aggregates to fragment without reaggregation into smaller isolated clusters, consistent with prior experimental work. At the highest shear rates, aggregation is inhibited completely.",The authors would like to acknowledge NSF for funding this work (NSF CBET #1437710).,,Langmuir,,,,2022-07-27,2022,2022-07-27,2022-08-09,38,31,9621-9630,,,"Laal-Dehghani, Nader; Christopher, Gordon F.","Laal-Dehghani, Nader (Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, 79409, United States); Christopher, Gordon F.

High-speed camera and Image J image analysis software were used to obtain the crack growth process of the specimen under impact load, and fractal dimension was introduced to quantitatively study the crack growth degree. The results show that more than 90% of the energy is stored in the specimen as elastic energy when it reaches the peak stress under static load. The average total energy of water-saturated specimens is 67.55% of that of dry specimens. The average energy dissipation density of water-saturated specimens under 0.3 MPa, 0.4 MPa and 0.5 MPa air pressure is 0.79, 0.91 and 0.92 times of that of dry specimens, respectively. Water-saturated specimens will deteriorate and thus reduce their energy storage and energy absorption effects. The reflected energy, transmitted energy, absorbed energy and incident energy are linear, logarithmic and linear functions, respectively, and the energy absorptivity and specific energy absorptivity of water-saturated specimens are lower than those of dry specimens. Due to the existence of “stefan” effect, the increase of energy dissipation density of water-saturated specimen at high strain rate is greater than that of dry specimen. The mean fractal dimension of water-saturated specimens under 0.3 MPa, 0.4 MPa and 0.5 MPa is 1.09, 1.05 and 1.16 times that of dry specimens. At the same strain rate, the number and width of cracks in water-saturated specimens are larger than that in dry specimens. Water-saturated behavior reduces the energy absorption capacity of tuff, increases the fractal dimension of crack growth, and significantly reduces the resistance of water-saturated rock to external loads.",This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.52074009).,,Scientific Reports,,,,2024-06-10,2024,2024-06-10,,14,1,13338,,,"Wang, Hao; Zong, Qi; Lu, Ziyi; Wang, Haibo","Wang, Hao (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Anhui University of Science and Technology, 232001, Huainan, Anhui, China); Zong, Qi (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Anhui University of Science and Technology, 232001, Huainan, Anhui, China); Lu, Ziyi (China Construction Sixth Bureau Eighth Construction Co., LTD, 230041, Hefei, Anhui, China); Wang, Haibo (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Anhui University of Science and Technology, 232001, Huainan, Anhui, China)","Zong, Qi (Anhui University of Science and Technology)","Wang, Hao (Anhui University of Science and Technology); Zong, Qi (Anhui University of Science and Technology); Lu, Ziyi (China Construction Sixth Bureau Eighth Construction Co., LTD, 230041, Hefei, Anhui, China); Wang, Haibo (Anhui University of Science and Technology)",0,0,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64273-4,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172679753,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Conducting fillers with two different geometries, carbon black and carbon nanotubes, were introduced in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) for physical insights into the structure formation of nanofillers by the application of periodic tensile stress. The loading of the nanofillers was selected beyond the percolation threshold to determine the cyclic stability of the resulting network channels. The surface chemistry of carbon nanotubes has been varied to understand the interfacial interactions at the molecular length scale. The combination of in situ stretching, annealing, and vis-à-vis conductometry of nanocomposite films with synchrotron-based ultra-small angle X-ray scattering experiments enables us to highlight the importance of the fractal dimensions of nanofillers for the molecular level interactions. The irreversible formation of nanofiller network geometries under cyclic stress and annealing was found to be responsible for the electrical properties of a flexible conducting film.","Most of the authors of this scientific contribution are mentored or greatly supported by Professor Dr. (Acad.)

STUDY DESIGN: Five identical periapical radiographs were obtained from each of 20 anatomic regions. Using ImageJ/Fiji software, a standardized region of interest was positioned in the trabecular bone of all radiographs, 14 BnMs were independently applied, and FD was calculated. The Friedman test and Dunn post hoc tests were used to evaluate the influence of BnMs on FD (α = 0.05). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess correlation among BnMs.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the threshold value between the BnMs. No significant differences in FD were observed among 9 BnMs (Default, Huang, Iso Data, Li, Mean, Min Error[I], Moments, Otsu, and Shanbhag). These methods presented significantly higher FDs than those from 3 other BnMs (Max Entropy, Renyi Entropy, and Yen), which did not significantly differ from each other. The Triangle method significantly differed from all BnMs, and the Percentile method produced significantly higher FDs than Huang, IsoData, Li, Moments, Otsu, and Shanbhag. Most BnMs presented good or excellent correlation (ICC ≥ 0.76).
CONCLUSIONS: Binarization methods influence FD of the alveolar bone from digital periapical radiographs; thus, this technical aspect is relevant for comparison purposes and should be standardized.

This paper presents a semi-empirical model that is able to predict mean floc size in a very broad shear range spanning from aggregation to floc fragmentation. Theoretical details and modifications relating to the orthokinetic flocculation output are also provided. Modelling changes in turbidity in relation to the velocity gradient with this model offer a mechanistic approach and provide kinetic agglomeration and breakage index ka and kb. The floc breakage mode is described by the relationship between the floc size and the Kolmogorov microscale. Shear-related floc restructuring is analysed by monitoring the fractal dimension. These models, as well as those used to determine floc porosity, density and volume fraction, are validated by the experimental results obtained from several flocculation operations conducted on ultrafine kaolin in a 4-litre reactor tank compliant with laws of geometric similarity.

In this study, four coal samples of varying ranks (Ro,max = 0.68%–2.86%) were selected, and different scale pores were obtained through low-pressure CO2 and Ar adsorption (LP-CO2/ArGA) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) experiments. A full-scale pore evaluation model was established, and the impact of pores on methane adsorption and restriction was analyzed and discussed through high-pressure adsorption experiments. Our results show that (1) at high pressures (> 100 MPa), the MIP technique caused pore compression and overestimated the pore size below 30 nm by up to 47.2%; (2) to obtain a comprehensive pore evaluation, we developed an accurate model that combines LP-CO2/ArGA with NLDFT and BJH and NLDFT models to determine micropore (0.3–1.5 nm) and mesopore (1.5–30 nm) parameters. By combining this model with MIP test results, we can obtain a full-scale pore size in the range of 0.3 nm–200 μm; (3) coal rank affected the development of full-scale pore characteristics. As coal rank increased, the specific surface area (SSA) of micropores and adsorption capacity of methane first decreased, then increased. Micropores were found to be the most important storage space for CBM and control gas adsorption, with a microporous SSA and PV to total SSA and total PV ratio of 97.93% and 63.69%, respectively. (4) We also observed a significant linear relationship between the fractal dimension of micropores and the Langmuir volume (VL) based on fractal theory. As the fractal dimension increased, VL also increased (R2 = 0.8581), indicating that VL is controlled by the complexity of micropores, which is consistent with the comprehensive evaluation index (Dt) and VL (R2 = 0.8744). Based on our predicted model, VL can be estimated using the SSA of micropores and Dt.

The purpose of this study is to observe the change in trabecular bone with fractal dimensional analysis from baseline to 3rd month of implant placement. It was also aimed to determine the correlation of fractal dimension (FD) change with morphometric indices, mandibular cortical index (MCI) and mandibular cortical width (MCW).
Methods: Digital panoramic radiographs taken from 14 patients were evaluated in this study. A total of 30 implants which were placed on mandibular premolar or molar region were included. MCI and MCW assessments were made on baseline radiograph and FD were analyzed on baseline and 3rd month radiograph. FD change by time was recorded separately for every ROI. A paired sample t-test was used to evaluate the change between FD-baseline and FD-3rdmonth values. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the relationship between FD change and MCI. FD change and MCW measurements correlation was calculated by Pearson correlation analysis.
Results: FD value increased in 75 of 90 implant-adjacent regions evaluated in the 3rd month and it was observed that the FD values were statistically significantly increased in the mesial, distal and apical regions at the 3rd month measurements. There was no statistically significant relationship between mean FD change and MCI, and there was no correlation between mean FD change and MCW value.
Discussion: There are many studies evaluating the resorptive changes in bone. However, there are few studies investigating whether there is a correlation between pre- and post-operative trabecular pattern with MCI and MCW.

Methods: Among 584 participants from the Three-City-Alienor (3C-Alienor) population-based cohort, quantitative retinal vascular features (caliber, tortuosity, fractal dimension) were measured using semi-automated software. Dementia was actively diagnosed over the follow-up period.
Results: One hundred twenty-eight participants (21.9%) developed dementia over a median of 7.1 years. In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, and vascular factors, increased retinal arteriolar tortuosity was associated with all-cause dementia (hazard ratio per standard deviation increase, 1.21; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.44). Wider retinal calibers and a higher venular tortuosity were associated with mixed/vascular dementia, but not Alzheimer's disease. Fractal dimensions were not associated with dementia.
Discussion: Changes in the retinal microvasculature were associated with dementia risk. More studies are needed to replicate these findings and determine which features might help identify persons at risk at an early stage.

These dynamics have often been modeled invoking a fractal structure of the medium although the fractal structure was only indirectly inferred through the dynamics. Moreover, systematic studies have not yet been performed. Here, colloidal particles moving in a laser speckle pattern are used as a model system. In this case, the experimental observations can be reliably traced to the fractal structure of the underlying medium with an adjustable fractal dimension. First-passage time statistics reveal that the particles explore the speckle in a self-similar, fractal manner at least over four decades in time and on length scales up to 20 times the particle radius. The requirements for fractal diffusion to be applicable are laid out, and methods to extract the fractal dimension are established.","We acknowledge fruitful discussions with M. Weiss and R. Metzler.

The physical model of a single fissured channel is obtained in combination with Barton standard curves and 3D printing technology, and similar materials of mudstone are developed based on the water absorption of natural mudstone to prepare single fissured water-absorbing grouting test blocks with different roughness levels for the grouting simulation testing. By analyzing the viscosity change characteristics of grouting slurry before and after grouting, the seepage characteristics of the grouting slurry in the rough fissures of the water-absorbing mudstone are revealed. The results show that when the roughness is small, the grouting slurry will have an obvious water loss effect after passing through mudstone fissures. However, with the flow of the slurry, the water loss effect of the subsequent grouting slurry will be weakened. For fissures with high roughness, the water absorption properties of the rough surfaces and the walls of the mudstone fissures work together, leading to the sedimentation and blockage of the fissure channels, thereby hindering the flow of slurry.",,"This research was funded by National Key R&D Program of China, grant number 2022YFE0129100, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, grant number 2020ZDPY0222, the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, grant number KYCX23_2745, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, grant number 2023XSCX052, the Graduate Innovation Program of China University of Mining and Technology, grant number 2023WLKXJ183.",Materials,,,,2024-02-06,2024,2024-02-06,,17,4,784,,,"Chen, Zhe; Zhou, Yue-Jin; Zhang, Lei-Ming; Xu, Yu-Nong","Chen, Zhe (State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Construction and Healthy Operation and Maintenance of Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China;, ts22030001a31@cumt.edu.cn, (Z.C.);, ts19030027a31@cumt.edu.cn, (L.-M.Z.);, xuyunong@cumt.edu.cn, (Y.-N.X.); School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China); Zhou, Yue-Jin (State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Construction and Healthy Operation and Maintenance of Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China;, ts22030001a31@cumt.edu.cn, (Z.C.);, ts19030027a31@cumt.edu.cn, (L.-M.Z.);, xuyunong@cumt.edu.cn, (Y.-N.X.); School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China); Zhang, Lei-Ming (State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Construction and Healthy Operation and Maintenance of Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China;, ts22030001a31@cumt.edu.cn, (Z.C.);, ts19030027a31@cumt.edu.cn, (L.-M.Z.);, xuyunong@cumt.edu.cn, (Y.-N.X.); School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China); Xu, Yu-Nong (State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Construction and Healthy Operation and Maintenance of Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China;, ts22030001a31@cumt.edu.cn, (Z.C.);, ts19030027a31@cumt.edu.cn, (L.-M.Z.);, xuyunong@cumt.edu.cn, (Y.-N.X.); School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China)","Zhou, Yue-Jin (China University of Mining and Technology; China University of Mining and Technology)","Chen, Zhe (China University of Mining and Technology; China University of Mining and Technology); Zhou, Yue-Jin (China University of Mining and Technology; China University of Mining and Technology); Zhang, Lei-Ming (China University of Mining and Technology; China University of Mining and Technology); Xu, Yu-Nong (China University of Mining and Technology; China University of Mining and Technology)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/4/784/pdf?version=1707211673,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168652058,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Conventional analyses like bruise area (BA), bruise volume (BV), and bruise susceptibility (BS) were also conducted. A correlation was performed to determine the relationship between image processing and conventional assessment of bruise damage in bananas. Weight, firmness, color, sugar content, and acidity were investigated. The results demonstrated that bananas bruised from the highest force and stored at 5 and 22 °C reported the lowest FD with values of 1.7162 and 1.7403, respectively. Increasing the level of damage reduced the fractal dimension and grayscale values and increased browning incidence and bruise susceptibility values after 48 h of storage. The total color change values showed a strong Pearson's correlation coefficient (r≥-0.81) with image analysis fractal dimension and grayscale values. The findings also indicated that higher bruising and temperature can induce weight loss, firmness reduction, lightness, and yellowness increment, and sugar and acidity changes. Overall, the fractal image analysis conducted in this study was highly effective in describing the bruising magnitude of bananas under different conditions.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Raw materials and obtained carbons were studied by TG, DTG, SEM and nitrogen adsorption porosimetry. The decomposition temperature ranges for hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin as the main component of the feedstock have been established. It is shown that the proposed method for the thermochemical treatment of coffee waste makes it possible to obtain activated carbon with a controllable pore size distribution and a high specific surface area (up to 1050 m2/g). A comparative study of the evolution of the distribution of pore size, pore area and pore volume has been carried out based on the BJH and NL-DFT (slit-like pores approximation) methods.

Well-known diseases in this category include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS), which are also addressed in this study. The CNS appears to be a complex dynamic system, whose parameters change during the disease due to neuronal damage, resulting in various symptoms. Since the change in dynamic behavior is due to the neurons’ death and change in neurons’ connectivity, brain images of the affected areas appear to provide a good understanding of this change. This work attempts to focus on brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) and examine the effect of neuronal loss on the images. To this end, the complex features of these images, including 2D and Higuchi’s fractal dimensions (HFD), correlation dimension (CD), largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), and approximate entropy (ApEn) were calculated. Despite small differences in numerical values (0.01–0.35), these values differ significantly. This shows that the brain dynamic system behaves and functions differently in the disease state, which is clear in the behavior of global features. These three diseases have the same functional pattern, and this study seems to have captured the roots of these seemingly variant diseases.Graphical Abstract",,,Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing,,,Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Parkinson Disease; Fractals,2023-01-04,2023,2023-01-04,2023-03,61,3,773-784,,,"Garehdaghi, Farnaz; Sarbaz, Yashar","Garehdaghi, Farnaz (Modeling Biological System’s Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran); Sarbaz, Yashar (Modeling Biological System’s Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran)","Sarbaz, Yashar (University of Tabriz)","Garehdaghi, Farnaz (University of Tabriz); Sarbaz, Yashar (University of Tabriz)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154228725,40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation; 4611 Machine Learning,

Steel slag powder (SSP) can be used as both aggregate and cementitious material according to different particle size. SSP has multiple influencing effects on coarse tailings cemented backfill (CTCB). Experiment with different content SSP in the CTCB was designed. And uniaxial compression, nuclear magnetic resonance and scanning electron microscopy techniques were used to characterize its macro and micro characteristics. The relationship model of aggregate characteristics on strength and porosity was established by analyzing the characteristics of aggregate using gradation and fractal. The conclusions mainly include: (1) SSP plays three main roles in the CTCB: optimizing the gradation, generating hydration reaction and influencing the hydration reaction of cement. (2) There are good gradation and fractal characteristics between SSP and coarse tailings, with a grading index of 0.30–0.61 and a fractal dimension of 2.12–2.61.

A single fractal dimension, in particular, has been commonly interpreted as characteristic of the entire image, such as an abstract painting, whether binary, gray-scale, or in color, and whether self-similar or not. There is now ample evidence, however, that fractal exponents obtained using the standard box-counting are strongly dependent on the details of the method adopted, and on fitting straight lines to the entire scaling plots, which are typically nonlinear. Here, we propose a more discriminating approach with the aim of obtaining robust scaling plots and extracting relevant information encoded in them without any fitting routines. To this goal, we carefully average over all possible grid locations at each scale, rendering scaling plots independent of any particular choice of grids and, crucially, of the orientation of images. We then calculate the derivatives of the scaling plots, so that an image is described by a continuous function, its fractal contour, rather than a single scaling exponent valid over a limited range of scales. We test this method on synthetic examples, ordered and random, then on images of algorithmically defined fractals, and finally, examine selected abstract paintings and prints by acknowledged masters of modern art.","We would like to acknowledge our earlier collaboration with David Martin, then a professor of Computer Science at Boston College, and thank him for his fruitful insights and for writing the first numerical codes (in Matlab) for fractal contours.

There are several methods to diagnose periodontitis, but no method to quantify the cancellous bone is presently used. For this purpose, a non-invasive tool that is efficient in analyzing bone quality called fractal analysis can be employed. The objective of the study was to utilize fractal dimension (FD) to evaluate cancellous patterns of interproximal alveolar bone using a digital intraoral periapical radiograph (IOPAR) in different clinical presentations of periodontitis classified according to the latest classification by the World Workshop for Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions, 2017 (WWDC, 2017). The study aimed to numerically calculate the periodontitis changes in the cancellous bone around the affected tooth on an IOPAR using fractal analysis and to provide an additional criterion for the staging of periodontitis. In this cross-sectional observational study, 75 patients were selected and equally allotted to five groups based on the staging system proposed by the WWDC, 2017. The region of interest was selected on the IOPA radiograph of the tooth with the site having the most significant clinical attachment loss, and FD was calculated using Image J analysis. The association of gender and age with stages of periodontitis was studied using the chi-square test of independence. A comparison of % bone loss and fractal dimension among stages was studied by using the non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test. The relationship between % bone loss and fractal dimension within stages and gender was studied by using the Karl Pearson correlation. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for FD value as a marker of periodontitis patients. We demonstrated that the FD values decreased significantly with the increase in stages (p < 0.0001). The overall relationship between % bone loss and FD showed a significantly strong negative correlation of -0.739 (p < 0.0001), except for stages III and IV. FD can be utilized as a quantitative method for detecting cancellous bone changes in different stages of periodontitis, aiding in diagnosing periodontitis.",,This research received no external funding.,Biomedicines,,Yoshitaka Hosokawa,,2023-09-16,2023,2023-09-16,,11,9,2547,,,"Mishra, Sukanya; Kumar, Manoj; Mishra, Lora; Panda, Swagatika; Panda, Saurav; Lewkowicz, Natalia; Lapinska, Barbara","Mishra, Sukanya (Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Institute of Dental Sciences and SUM Hospital, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar 751003, India;, drmishrasukanya@gmail.com, (S.M.);, sauravpanda@soa.ac.in, (S.P.)); Kumar, Manoj (Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Institute of Dental Sciences and SUM Hospital, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar 751003, India;, drmishrasukanya@gmail.com, (S.M.);, sauravpanda@soa.ac.in, (S.P.)); Mishra, Lora (Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Institute of Dental Sciences and SUM Hospital, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar 751003, India;, loramishra@soa.ac.in); Panda, Swagatika (Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Institute of Dental Sciences and SUM Hospital, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar 751003, India;, swagatikapanda@soa.ac.in); Panda, Saurav (Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Institute of Dental Sciences and SUM Hospital, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar 751003, India;, drmishrasukanya@gmail.com, (S.M.);, sauravpanda@soa.ac.in, (S.P.)); Lewkowicz, Natalia (Department of Periodontology and Oral Diseases, Medical University of Lodz, 251 Pomorska St, 92-213 Lodz, Poland;, natalia.lewkowicz@umed.lodz.pl); Lapinska, Barbara (Department of General Dentistry, Medical University of Lodz, 251 Pomorska St, 92-213 Lodz, Poland)","Kumar, Manoj (Siksha O Anusandhan University; Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Institute of Dental Sciences and SUM Hospital, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar 751003, India;, drmishrasukanya@gmail.com, (S.M.);, sauravpanda@soa.ac.in, (S.P.)); Lapinska, Barbara (Medical University of Lodz)","Mishra, Sukanya (Siksha O Anusandhan University; Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Institute of Dental Sciences and SUM Hospital, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar 751003, India;, drmishrasukanya@gmail.com, (S.M.);, sauravpanda@soa.ac.in, (S.P.)); Kumar, Manoj (Siksha O Anusandhan University; Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Institute of Dental Sciences and SUM Hospital, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar 751003, India;, drmishrasukanya@gmail.com, (S.M.);, sauravpanda@soa.ac.in, (S.P.)); Mishra, Lora (Siksha O Anusandhan University); Panda, Swagatika (Siksha O Anusandhan University); Panda, Saurav (Siksha O Anusandhan University; Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Institute of Dental Sciences and SUM Hospital, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar 751003, India;, drmishrasukanya@gmail.com, (S.M.);, sauravpanda@soa.ac.in, (S.P.)); Lewkowicz, Natalia (Medical University of Lodz); Lapinska, Barbara (Medical University of Lodz)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/11/9/2547/pdf?version=1694842640,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164183697,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

Many computational algorithms were employed to predict the essential proteins; however, they have various restrictions. To improve the prediction accuracy, by introducing the Local Fuzzy Fractal Dimension (LFFD) of complex networks into the analysis of the PPI network, we propose a novel algorithm named LDS, which combines the LFFD of the PPI network with the protein subcellular location information.

The cell-cell boundary layers, depending on the relative adhesion forces, can result in kinks in the border, similar to fingering patterns between two viscous partially miscible fluids which can be characterized by its fractal dimension. This suggests that mathematical models used to analyze the fingering patterns can be applied to cell migration data as a metric for intercellular adhesion forces. In this study, we develop a novel computational analysis method to characterize the interactions between blood endothelial cells (BECs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), which form segregated vasculature by recognizing each other through podoplanin. We observed indiscriminate mixing with LEC-LEC and BEC-BEC pairs and a sharp boundary between LEC-BEC pair, and fingering-like patterns with pseudo-LEC-BEC pairs. We found that the box counting method yields fractal dimension between 1 for sharp boundaries and 1.3 for indiscriminate mixing, and intermediate values for fingering-like boundaries. We further verify that these results are due to differential affinity by performing random walk simulations with differential attraction to nearby cells and generate similar migration pattern, confirming that higher differential attraction between different cell types result in lower fractal dimensions. We estimate the characteristic velocity and interfacial tension for our simulated and experimental data to show that the fractal dimension negatively correlates with capillary number (Ca), further indicating that the mathematical models used to study viscous fingering pattern can be used to characterize cell-cell mixing. Taken together, these results indicate that the fractal analysis of segregation boundaries can be used as a simple metric to estimate relative cell-cell adhesion forces between different cell types.","We acknowledge support from the University of Notre Dame through ‘Advancing Our Vision’ Initiative in Stem Cell Research, Harper Cancer Research Institute—American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant (IRG-17-182-04), American Heart Association through Career Development Award (19-CDA-34630012 to D H-P), National Institutes of Health (1R35-GM-143055-01 to D H-P), National Science Foundation (NSF GRFP to D P J and 2225601 to D H-P and H-C C), and Center for Bioanalytic and Metrology NSF/Industry grant to H-C C and D H-P.",,Physical Biology,,,Fractals; Endothelial Cells; Cell Movement,2023-06-12,2023,2023-06-12,2023-07-01,20,4,045004,,,"Jeong, Donghyun Paul; Montes, Daniel; Chang, Hsueh-Chia; Hanjaya-Putra, Donny","Jeong, Donghyun Paul (Bioengineering Graduate Program, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America; Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America); Montes, Daniel (Bioengineering Graduate Program, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America; Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America); Chang, Hsueh-Chia (Bioengineering Graduate Program, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America; Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America; Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America; Harper Cancer Research Institute, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America; Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America); Hanjaya-Putra, Donny (Bioengineering Graduate Program, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America; Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America; Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America; Harper Cancer Research Institute, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America; Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, United States of America)","Hanjaya-Putra, Donny (University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame)","Jeong, Donghyun Paul (University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame); Montes, Daniel (University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame); Chang, Hsueh-Chia (University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame); Hanjaya-Putra, Donny (University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame)",3,3,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1478-3975/acd898/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158320306,31 Biological Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering,

Parameters extracted from the tumor interface fluctuations allow for the characterization of the particular growth model, which could be relevant for an appropriate diagnosis and the correspondent therapeutic strategy. Previous work, based on scaling analysis of the tumor interface, demonstrated that gliomas strictly behave as it is proposed by the Family-Vicsek ansatz, which corresponds to a proliferative-invasive growth model, while for meningiomas and acoustic schwannomas, a proliferative growth model is more suitable. In the present work, other morphological and dynamical descriptors are used as a complementary view, such as surface regularity, one-dimensional fluctuations represented as ordered series and bi-dimensional fluctuations of the tumor interface. These fluctuations were analyzed by Detrended Fluctuation Analysis to determine generalized fractal dimensions. Results indicate that tumor interface fractal dimension, local roughness exponent and surface regularity are parameters that discriminate between gliomas and meningiomas/schwannomas.","This research was supported by Universidad Central de Venezuela, INABIO and Universidad Nacional Pedro Henríquez Ureña.

Methods: Retrospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 42 glioma patients (LGG, n = 27 and HGG, n = 15) were used in this study. Using MRI, we calculated different FD measures based on the general structure, boundary, and skeleton aspects of the tumorous and non-tumorous brain GM and WM regions. Texture features, namely, angular second moment, contrast, inverse difference moment, correlation, and entropy, were also measured in the tumorous and non-tumorous regions. The efficacy of FD features was assessed by comparing them with texture features. Statistical inference and machine learning approaches were used on the aforementioned measures to distinguish LGG and HGG patients. Results: FD measures from tumorous and non-tumorous regions were able to distinguish LGG and HGG patients. Among the 15 different FD measures, the general structure FD values of enhanced tumor regions yielded high accuracy (93%), sensitivity (97%), specificity (98%), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score (98%). Non-tumorous GM skeleton FD values also yielded good accuracy (83.3%), sensitivity (100%), specificity (60%), and AUC score (80%) in classifying the tumor grades. These measures were also found to be significantly (p < 0.05) different between LGG and HGG patients. On the other hand, among the 25 texture features, enhanced tumor region features, namely, contrast, correlation, and entropy, revealed significant differences between LGG and HGG. In machine learning, the enhanced tumor region texture features yielded high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC score. Conclusion: A comparison between texture and FD features revealed that FD analysis on different aspects of the tumorous and non-tumorous components not only distinguished LGG and HGG patients with high statistical significance and classification accuracy but also provided better insights into glioma grade classification. Therefore, FD features can serve as potential neuroimaging biomarkers for glioma.","The authors thank the Department of Biotechnology for funding this study, the patients and their caregivers.","This study was supported by the Department of Biotechnology, India, under Project Number: BT PR 30007/MED/32/660/2018).",Frontiers in Physiology,,,,2023-07-17,2023,2023-07-17,,14,,1201617,,,"Battalapalli, Dheerendranath; Vidyadharan, Sreejith; Rao, B.

A meticulous examination of both burst-prone and non-burst-prone coal samples during destruction processes was undertaken to decipher the dynamic compression mechanical attributes from perspectives of energy and fragmentatio‘s fractal dimensions. Burst-prone coal showcases a more pronounced escalation in fragmentation work in comparison to non-burst-prone samples, thereby illustrating a perceptible strain-rate dependent effect correlating with enhanced strain rates. Additionally, it was observed that incident, reflected, and transmitted energy trajectories for both sample categories follow an approximately linear ascendancy, albeit exhibiting diverse magnitudes. Burst-prone coal manifests a more rapid and focused energy growth compared to its non-burst-prone counterpart. When subjected to impact loads, a notable trend was discerned where the fragmentation’s fractional dimension escalated persistently with both the incident energy and the crushing work, portraying a prominent growth effect. The insights garnered from this study pave the way for distinguishing between impacted and unimpacted coal samples using energy perspectives and fragmentation's fractal dimensions.",,This research was funded by the Guizhou Province Science and Technology Support Plan Project of China (Qiankehe Support [2021] General 400).

Methods: In this observational study, retinal fundus images were collected from 36 patients with unilateral amblyopia, 33 patients with bilateral amblyopia, and 36 healthy control volunteers. We developed a customized training algorithm based on U-Net to digitalize the vasculature in the fundus images to quantify vascular density (area and fractal dimension), skeleton length, and number of bifurcation points. For statistical comparisons, this study divided participants into two groups. The amblyopic eyes and the fellow eyes of patients with unilateral amblyopia formed the paired group, while bilateral amblyopic patients and healthy controls formed the independent group.
Results: In the paired group, the vascular area (P = 0.007), vascular fractal dimension (P = 0.007), and vascular skeleton length (P = 0.002) of the amblyopic eyes were significantly smaller than those of the fellow eyes. In the independent group, significant decreases in the vascular fractal dimension (P = 0.006) and skeleton length (P = 0.048) were observed in bilateral amblyopia compared to control. The vascular area was also significantly correlated with best-corrected visual acuity in amblyopic eyes.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated that retinal vascular density and skeleton length in amblyopic eyes were significantly smaller compared to control, indicating an association between the changes in retinal vascular features and the state of amblyopia.
Translational Relevance: Our algorithm presents amblyopic retinal vascular changes that are more biologically interpretable for both clinicians and researchers.","Supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology (2022ZD0208604, 2022ZD0208605 to JZ; 2022ZD0210000 to BY; 81970790 to XY), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31771195, 81790640, 81773513, 82071200 to JZ; 32100803 to BY), Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (2018SHZDZX01 to JZ), Key Research and Development Program of Ningxia (2022BEG02046 to JZ), Sanming Project of Medicine in Shenzhen (SZSM202011015 to JZ and XY), Key Scientific Technological Innovation Research Project of the Ministry of Education (JZ), and Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (SGDX20211123120001001, JCYJ2020010914500181 to XY).

Cracking in concrete can be one of the most critical problems, and its healing is important for structural safety. The current study proposes the evaluation of crack healing in geopolymer concrete (GPC) using different linear and nonlinear ultrasonic techniques. In this regard, a notched GPC beam was constructed at the laboratory and geopolymer grout was applied as a repair material. Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and signal waveform tests were performed at several stages before and after grouting the notch. Nonlinear wave signals were processed in the phase-space domain for qualitative health monitoring of GPC. Furthermore, feature extraction was applied to phase-plane attractors using fractal dimension for quantitative assessment. The sideband peak count-index (SPC-I) method was also utilized to assess the ultrasound waves. The results indicate that the phase-space analysis of ultrasound can successfully represent the healing progress inside the GPC beam. At the same time, the fractal dimension can be used as a healing index. Ultrasound signal attenuation demonstrated high sensitivity to crack healing. The SPC-I technique exhibited an inconsistent trend at the early stage of healing. However, it provided a clear indication of repair at the advanced stage. Although the linear UPV method was found sensitive to the grouting at the initial stages, it demonstrated insufficient capability to monitor the healing process fully. Therefore, the phase-space-based ultrasonic method and the attenuation parameter could be employed as reliable techniques for the robust monitoring of progressive healing in concrete.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,Funding,Ultrasonics,,,,2023-06-25,2023,2023-06-25,2023-09,134,,107095,,,"Rahmati, Mohammad; Toufigh, Vahab; Keyvan, Kaveh","Rahmati, Mohammad (Department of Civil Engineering, The Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.); Toufigh, Vahab (Department of Civil Engineering, The Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

METHODS: Thirty eyes of 30 patients with idiopathic ERM who underwent OCTA were retrospectively evaluated. Image processing of OCTA, including the Mexican hat filter (MHF) and exclusion of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), was attempted using Fiji. OCTA parameters, including vessel density (VD), fractal dimension (FD), and vessel tortuosity (VT), were measured for large vessels only, capillaries only, and the whole vasculature. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlations between best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and OCTA parameters.
RESULTS: The correlations between BCVA and retinal vasculature were much increased when the capillaries only instead of the whole vasculature was used for analysis. Both higher VD and FD of capillaries were correlated with better BCVA, and MHF largely increased their correlations (P < 0.0001 for both). In contrast, both higher VD and FD of the large vessels were associated with poorer BCVA (P = 0.042 and 0.049, respectively). A higher VT of capillaries was correlated with better BCVA, and both MHF and exclusion of the FAZ were necessary to reveal their correlations (P = 0.028) CONCLUSIONS: Separation of large vessels and capillaries was necessary to reveal the correlations between retinal vasculature and BCVA in ERM. MHF was necessary to elucidate all microvascular parameters of capillaries, and exclusion of the FAZ was mandatory for evaluation of VT.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no competing interests.

However, less attention is paid to deep shale (>3000 m) which has unique pore characteristics that distinguish it from the shallow and medium layers. In order to study the pore structure characteristics of deep shale, 10 samples of the Shanxi Formation are collected from well YP-1 within the depth of 3550-3610 m in the Fuxian block of the Ordos Basin. The pore structure characteristics of shale samples are quantitatively studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), low-temperature nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and high-pressure mercury injection experiments. The pore surface area (SA) and pore volume (PV) of the deep shale of Shanxi formation are low, with average values of 4.282 m2/g and 0.0126 mL/g, respectively. The content of total organic carbon (TOC) is high, which is in the high over mature stage, with undeveloped organic pores and developed microfractures. The main mineral components are clay (51.6%∼89.1%) and quartz (8%∼41.7%). By establishing the relationship between SA, PV, and TOC for quartz and clay minerals, it is found that these three parameters have little contribution to SA and PV. The pore diameter is mainly mesoporous, 2.5-4 nm and 8-11 nm. The complexity of pore structure is discussed through the fractal dimension calculated by the fractal Frenkel-Halsey-Hill (FHH) model. The pore fractal dimension D 2 (2.6240) is greater than D 1 (2.5608), and the complexity of the pore structure is greater than that of the pore surface. The fractal dimension of deep shale in Shanxi is negatively correlated with TOC content and weakly correlated with quartz and clay minerals. It shows that the mineral composition of deep shale in Shanxi Formation in the study area has little effect on pore development, and the development of microfractures is the main contribution of SA and PV.",This work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41927801 and 41972132) and National Science and Technology Major Project (Grant No. 2016ZX05034002-001).,,ACS Omega,,,,2022-03-14,2022,2022-03-14,2022-03-22,7,11,9229-9243,,,"Yang, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Jinchuan; Xu, Longfei; Li, Pei; Liu, Yang; Dang, Wei","Yang, Yuanyuan (School of Energy and Resources, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), Beijing, 100083, China; Key Laboratory of Strategy Evaluation for Shale Gas, Ministry of Natural Resources, Beijing, 100083, China); Zhang, Jinchuan (School of Energy and Resources, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), Beijing, 100083, China; Key Laboratory of Strategy Evaluation for Shale Gas, Ministry of Natural Resources, Beijing, 100083, China); Xu, Longfei (School of Energy and Resources, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), Beijing, 100083, China; Key Laboratory of Strategy Evaluation for Shale Gas, Ministry of Natural Resources, Beijing, 100083, China); Li, Pei (Petroleum Exploration and Production Research Institute, China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (SINOPEC), No. 31 Xueyuan Road, Beijing, 100083, China); Liu, Yang (School of Energy and Resources, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), Beijing, 100083, China; Key Laboratory of Strategy Evaluation for Shale Gas, Ministry of Natural Resources, Beijing, 100083, China); Dang, Wei (School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Xi’an Shiyou University, Xi’an, 710065, China)","Zhang, Jinchuan (China University of Geosciences; Ministry of Natural Resources)","Yang, Yuanyuan (China University of Geosciences; Ministry of Natural Resources); Zhang, Jinchuan (China University of Geosciences; Ministry of Natural Resources); Xu, Longfei (China University of Geosciences; Ministry of Natural Resources); Li, Pei (Sinopec (China)); Liu, Yang (China University of Geosciences; Ministry of Natural Resources); Dang, Wei (Xi'an Shiyou University)",10,10,,2.47,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8945116,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146257974,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

Scientists are focusing on the cancerous cells' plasma membrane (PM) as a potential therapeutic target in cancer because it functions as the cell's interface with its environment through a variety of mechanisms. The capacity of membrane shape and its structures to influence biological processes frequently occurs through the regulation of enzymes or preferential protein binding to membranes via membrane shape changes. We aimed here to assess the morphological irregularities of the cellular membranes in gastric adenocarcinoma tumors, and to find any putative differences from normal gastric mucosae epithelial cells. We analyzed the pattern of E-cadherin at the level of the cell membrane using the fractal dimension (FD) analysis on fluorescence immunohistochemistry samples labeled with E-cadherin in gastric well/moderate and solid gastric adenocarcinoma from patients without any associated chemotherapeutic treatment or radiotherapy. Images were binarized based on a fixed threshold of the E-cadherin fluorescence channel, and then the FD of the binarized image outlines has been calculated in order to assess the ruggedness of the cellular membranes. Overall assessment of the FD revealed that the subtle membrane variations were evident enough to deem a statistically significant difference and the complexity of the membrane roughness was clearly higher for adenocarcinoma cases. We intended to evaluate if separating adenocarcinoma cases as low grade (G1 and G2) and high grade (G3 and solid), FD analysis could still differentiate membrane patterns and check if the available clinical parameters like age, gender, tumor location, lymph ganglia involved might correlate with FD values for adenocarcinoma patients. Altogether, the morphological analysis of a simple marker for the cell membrane can identify and distinguish tumor cells. Although there was a limited correlation between this analysis and the main clinical and pathological indicators of the disease, it will be very useful in the future for automatic computer-assisted diagnosis on slides, as well as for evaluating cellular adhesion and inter-cellular trafficking in cancer cells.","This work was supported by a grant of Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCSUEFISCDI, PN-III-P4-ID-PCCF2016-0158 (THERRES), within PN III.",,Current Health Sciences Journal,,,,2022-09-30,2022,2022-09-30,2022,48,3,303-310,,,"Liliac, Ilona Mihaela; Sacerdoțianu, Mihai Victor; Ungureanu, Bogdan Silviu; Mogoantă, Laurențiu; Mărgăritescu, Claudiu; Pirici, Daniel; Săftoiu, Adrian; Crisan, Anda Elena","Liliac, Ilona Mihaela (Department of Histology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.); Sacerdoțianu, Mihai Victor (Department of Gastroenterology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.); Ungureanu, Bogdan Silviu (Department of Gastroenterology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.); Mogoantă, Laurențiu (Department of Histology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.); Mărgăritescu, Claudiu (Department of Pathology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.); Pirici, Daniel (Department of Histology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.); Săftoiu, Adrian (Department of Research Methodology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.); Crisan, Anda Elena (Department of Oncology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova, Romania.)",,"Liliac, Ilona Mihaela (University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova); Sacerdoțianu, Mihai Victor (University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova); Ungureanu, Bogdan Silviu (University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova); Mogoantă, Laurențiu (University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova); Mărgăritescu, Claudiu (University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova); Pirici, Daniel (University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova); Săftoiu, Adrian (University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova); Crisan, Anda Elena (University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova)",1,1,0.86,0.45,http://dx.doi.org/10.12865/chsj.48.03.08,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155534245,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

The hydrophobic force is likely a capillary force that arises from the formation of capillary bridges due to the merging of nanobubbles. In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of the nanobubble surface charge on the capillary bridge and, subsequently, the interaction between particles. The surface charge of the nanobubbles was altered in the presence of various surfactants (cationic, anionic, and nonionic) and salts (mono-, di-, and trivalent). The particle-particle interaction was quantified by measuring the aggregate size of the hydrophobized glass particles. Both experimental and theoretical findings confirm that the interaction between particles was enhanced when the surface potential of the nanobubble was around the neutral regime. This is probably because, when the surface potential was close to neutral, the interaction between two surface-deposited nanobubbles dominated over electrostatic repulsion, which was more conducive to the formation of the nanobubble capillary bridge. The estimation of the constrained Gibbs potential also showed the capillary bridge to be more stable when surface charge density along the bridge gas-liquid interface was minimal.",The authors acknowledge DST Inspire scheme DST/INSPIRE/04/2016/001163 under DST and Technology Innovation Hub at the Indian Institute of Technology Ropar in the framework of National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (NM-ICPS) for the funding of this work.,,Langmuir,,,,2024-02-15,2024,2024-02-15,2024-02-27,40,8,4475-4488,,,"Dutta, Nilanjan; Mitra, Subhasish; Nirmalkar, Neelkanth","Dutta, Nilanjan (Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, Punjab, 140001, India); Mitra, Subhasish (ARC Center of Excellence for Enabling Eco-efficient Beneficiation of Minerals, School of Engineering, The University of Newcastle, New South Wales, 2308, Australia); Nirmalkar, Neelkanth (Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, Punjab, 140001, India)","Nirmalkar, Neelkanth (Indian Institute of Technology Ropar)","Dutta, Nilanjan (Indian Institute of Technology Ropar); Mitra, Subhasish (University of Newcastle Australia); Nirmalkar, Neelkanth (Indian Institute of Technology Ropar)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168885306,34 Chemical Sciences; 3406 Physical Chemistry,

The pore structure features of coal samples taken from high gas seam were obtained by mercury injection porosimetry (MIP) and gas adsorption methods. The process of deformation and failure for coal samples under three-point bending conditions were obtained. The results demonstrate that the adsorption pores with diameter less than 100 nm are the most developed and their surfaces are the roughest (the average surface fractal dimension Ds is 2.933). The surface of micro-cracks is smoother (Ds is 2.481), which is conducive to gas seepage. It may be the explanation for that 14-3# coal seam is a high gas seam, while there was almost no gas outburst accident so far. At the initial stage of crack propagation, the main crack on the coal sample expanded along the direction of the natural cracks. In the process of crack propagation, the surface fractal dimension of the main crack increased, suggesting that the bending degree of the main crack enhanced.

In particular, when new AChE inhibitors are developed, much attention is paid to the specificity of their action. One of the approaches used to study the specificity is to compare AChE taken from various organisms. In this work, crystallographic data are used to investigate the active sites of AChE (ASAs) in the free (uncomplexed) state for the following five organisms: Homo sapiens (HS), Mus musculus (MM), Torpedo californica (TC), Electrophorus electricus (EE), and Drosophila melanogaster (DM). The structural fractal analysis (SFA) proposed by us earlier is used as a research method. This method is based on the calculation and comparison of the fractal dimensions of molecular structures. SFA demonstrates that there are no significant structural differences between the active sites of human AChE and other AChEs. However, differences are found for the MM/EE pair. Further analysis of individual AARs has revealed two different areas of active sites. Ser203, Trp236, Phe338, and Tyr341 are found to belong to a variable region, and the remaining AARs belong to a conservative region of the ASAs.

Utilizing CO2 in shale formations can significantly enhance the extraction of shale oil or gas. Conducting fundamental research on how CO2 affects shale rock's physical properties is crucial for enhancing its porosity and permeability. Particularly for deep shale layers, the effects of supercritical CO2 on shale physical properties should be investigated at a high temperature and pressure, differing from the standard conditions applied in shallower layers. A study examined the impact of supercritical CO2 under such conditions on the pore-throat structure and mineral composition of the shale. The experimental parameters included immersing shale rock in supercritical CO2 at pressures ranging from 10 to 70 MPa and temperatures between 55 and 95 °C. This study evaluated changes in mineral composition, pore-throat structure (using scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption tests), and the porosity and permeability of the shale rocks. Findings indicated that the dissolution of CO2 altered the relative content of certain minerals. The average quartz content rose and, potassium feldspar and the average contents of plagioclase declined conversely. When increasing the pressure, an increase in the relative content of I/S mixed layer and a decrease in illite content were observed and kaolinite content experienced minor changes. When increasing the temperature, kaolinite, I/S mixed layer, and chlorite all exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing temperature, while the relative contents of illite increased. Some of the pores become rounded in a high-magnification view under the impact of CO2 dissolution. Additionally, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area, pore volume, porosity, and permeability generally improved with increasing pressure and temperature. With the temperature and pressure of CO2 increased, the curves of nitrogen absorption had moved first upward and then downward. However, under specific CO2 conditions, the permeability enhancement effect could diminish or even negatively impact the shale's permeability. These findings underscore the need to optimize supercritical CO2 injection parameters under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. This research aims to provide theoretical guidance for the efficient use of CO2 in deep shale applications to increase the shale gas output.","This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant (2022YFE0206700), Natural Science Fund of Hebei Province (E2020203013), National Natural Science Foundation of China (52274074) and Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (2024JC-YBMS-387).",,ACS Omega,,,,2024-03-25,2024,2024-03-25,2024-04-02,9,13,15259-15270,,,"Wang, Xiangzeng; Sun, Xiao; Guo, Xing; Zheng, Liming; Luo, Pan","Wang, Xiangzeng (Research Institute of Shaanxi Yanchang Petroleum (Group) Co.

The sample consisted of 40 participants. Digital panoramic radiography (DPR) and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) were evaluated along with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is the gold standard for detecting low BMD. According to the T-scores of DXA, the subjects were assigned into two groups: with normal BMD and with low BMD (osteopenia and osteoporosis). The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity with their respective confidence intervals were determined for DPR and CBCT. For DPR indices, AUC ranged from 52.6 to 75.8%. The mandibular cortical width (MCW) had the highest AUC. For FD, the total trabecular index had the highest sensitivity, while the index anterior to the mental foramen (MF) had the highest specificity. In CBCT, the AUC ranged from 51.8 to 62.0%. The indices with the highest AUC were the molar (M) and anterior (A). The symphysis (S) index had the highest sensitivity and the posterior (P) index had the highest specificity. Sensitivity and specificity were adequate for the computed tomography index (Inferior; CTI [I]). Therefore, MCW, FD of the mandible angle, and total trabecular ROI in DPR and the CTI (I), M, P, and A indices in CBCT proved to be promising tools in distinguishing individuals with low BMD. Cutoff point for these indices could be a useful tool to investigate low BMD in postmenopausal women taking AI.","This study was supported by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (Capes, Finance Code 001), Brazil.

Such patient may (MCS+) or may not (MCS-) exhibit high-level behavioral responses, and the two groups retain two inherently different rehabilitative paths and expected outcomes. We hypothesized that brain complexity may be treated as a proxy of high-level cognition and thus could be used as a neural correlate of consciousness.Approach.In this prospective observational study, 68 MCS patients (MCS-: 30; women: 31) were included (median [IQR] age 69 [20]; time post-onset 83 [28]). At admission to intensive rehabilitation, 30 min resting-state closed-eyes recordings were performed together with consciousness diagnosis following international guidelines. The width of the multifractal singularity spectrum (MSS) was computed for each channel time series and entered nested cross-validated interpretable machine learning models targeting the differential diagnosis of MCS±.Main results.Frontal MSS widths (p< 0.05), as well as the ones deriving from the left centro-temporal network (C3:p= 0.018, T3:p= 0.017; T5:p= 0.003) were found to be significantly higher in the MCS+ cohort. The best performing solution was found to be the K-nearest neighbor model with an aggregated test accuracy of 75.5% (median [IQR] AuROC for 100 executions 0.88 [0.02]). Coherently, the electrodes with highest Shapley values were found to be Fz and Cz, with four out the first five ranked features belonging to the fronto-central network.Significance.MCS+ is a frequent condition associated with a notably better prognosis than the MCS-. High fractality in the left centro-temporal network results coherent with neurological networks involved in the language function, proper of MCS+ patients. Using EEG-based interpretable algorithm to complement differential diagnosis of consciousness may improve rehabilitation pathways and communications with caregivers.",,,Journal of Neural Engineering,,,Humans; Female; Aged; Persistent Vegetative State; Fractals; Brain; Consciousness; Electroencephalography,2023-08-01,2023,2023-08-25,2023-08-01,20,4,046038,,,"Liuzzi, Piergiuseppe; Hakiki, Bahia; Draghi, Francesca; Romoli, Anna Maria; Burali, Rachele; Scarpino, Maenia; Cecchi, Francesca; Grippo, Antonello; Mannini, Andrea","Liuzzi, Piergiuseppe (IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Via di Scandicci 269, Firenze, FI, Italy; The Biorobotics Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna Istituto di BioRobotica, Viale Rinaldo Piaggio 34, Pontedera, PI, Italy); Hakiki, Bahia (IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Via di Scandicci 269, Firenze, FI, Italy); Draghi, Francesca (IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Via di Scandicci 269, Firenze, FI, Italy); Romoli, Anna Maria (IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Via di Scandicci 269, Firenze, FI, Italy); Burali, Rachele (IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Via di Scandicci 269, Firenze, FI, Italy); Scarpino, Maenia (IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Via di Scandicci 269, Firenze, FI, Italy); Cecchi, Francesca (IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Via di Scandicci 269, Firenze, FI, Italy; Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Largo Brambilla 3, Florence, 50143 FI, Italy); Grippo, Antonello (IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Via di Scandicci 269, Firenze, FI, Italy); Mannini, Andrea (IRCCS Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi ONLUS, Via di Scandicci 269, Firenze, FI, Italy)","Hakiki, Bahia (Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation)","Liuzzi, Piergiuseppe (Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation; Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies); Hakiki, Bahia (Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation); Draghi, Francesca (Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation); Romoli, Anna Maria (Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation); Burali, Rachele (Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation); Scarpino, Maenia (Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation); Cecchi, Francesca (Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation; University of Florence); Grippo, Antonello (Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation); Mannini, Andrea (Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162763296,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences,

The treatment option highly depends on the maturation stage of the midpalatal suture (MPS), which may vary between individuals at the same chronological age. Therefore, the individual determination of the MPS maturation is crucial.
AIMS: Our aim was to investigate the applicability of fractal analysis for the quantitative evaluation of MPS maturation.
METHODS: Nine experienced orthodontists were asked to evaluate the MPS maturation on 51 cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans according to the Angelieri classification method. Intra- and inter-examiner reliability was measured using Cohen's Kappa coefficient. The stages were agreed upon according to the results of the examiners with the highest strength of agreement. Fractal analysis was then performed on the CBCTs and the correlation between the fractal dimension values and maturation stages was then evaluated. Optimal fractal dimension cut-off values were determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve.
RESULTS: The cut-off point was found at 1.073, at which the use of fractal dimension for predicting MPS maturation showed 100% sensitivity, 93.7% specificity, 9.5% false positive, 0% false negative rate.
CONCLUSION: Our results provided further evidence that fractal analysis is a reliable tool to determine MPS maturation stage.",,This research received no external funding.,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,"Antonella Polimeni, Peter Proff",,2023-06-21,2023,2023-06-21,,12,13,4189,,,"Darawsheh, Ali Farid; Kolarovszki, Béla; Hong, Da Hye; Farkas, Nelli; Taheri, Soroush; Frank, Dorottya","Darawsheh, Ali Farid (Department of Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical School, University of Pécs, 7624 Pécs, Hungary.); Kolarovszki, Béla (Department of Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical School, University of Pécs, 7624 Pécs, Hungary.); Hong, Da Hye (Department of Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical School, University of Pécs, 7624 Pécs, Hungary.); Farkas, Nelli (Institute of Bioanalysis, Medical School, University of Pécs, 7624 Pécs, Hungary.); Taheri, Soroush (Department of Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical School, University of Pécs, 7624 Pécs, Hungary.); Frank, Dorottya (Department of Dentistry, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical School, University of Pécs, 7624 Pécs, Hungary.)","Frank, Dorottya (University of Pecs)","Darawsheh, Ali Farid (University of Pecs); Kolarovszki, Béla (University of Pecs); Hong, Da Hye (University of Pecs); Farkas, Nelli (University of Pecs); Taheri, Soroush (University of Pecs); Frank, Dorottya (University of Pecs)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/13/4189/pdf?version=1687347288,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160068873,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

The mutations characterize populations in the world as well as genetic causes of diseases. In the approach that we follow, we study the patterns of gaps between mutations by means of the rescaled range analysis and the fractal dimension estimates. The results for chromosomes 1 to 22 and X indicate the existence of the so-called Hurst phenomenon in all of them. The interpretation of this outcome entails the presence of long-range correlations and we propose an explanation based on the genomic feature dubbed linkage disequilibrium, a nonrandom association of alleles at different loci. An unexpected outcome is the noteworthy uniform reduction in the Hurst phenomenon when considering the centimorgan metric instead of base position units.

It also has direct effects on human lungs, causing significant damage. CT-scans are commonly employed in such circumstances to promptly evaluate, detect, and treat COVID-19 patients. Without any filtering, CT-scan images are more difficult to identify the damaged parts of the lungs and determine the severity of various diseases. In this paper, we use the multifractal theory to evaluate COVID-19 patient’s CT-scan images to analyze the complexity of the various patient’s original, filtered, and edge detected CT-scan images. To precisely characterize the severity of the disease, the original, noisy and denoised images are compared. Furthermore, the edge detection and filtered methods called Robert, Prewitt, and Sobel are applied to analyze the various patient’s COVID-19 CT-scan images and examined by the multifractal measure in the proposed technique. All of the images are converted, filtered and edge detected using Robert, Prewitt, and Sobel edge detection algorithms, and compared by the Generalized Fractal Dimensions are compared. For the CT-scan images of COVID-19 patients, the various Qualitative Measures are also computed exactly for the filtered and edge detected images by Robert, Prewitt, and Sobel schemes. It is observed that Sobel method is performed well for classifying the COIVD-19 patients’ CT-scans used in this research study, when compared to other algorithms. Since the image complexity of the Sobel method is very high for all the images and then more complexity of the images contains more clarity to confirm the COVID-19 images.

Hereby, we show that, in an event-based ensemble, the critical behaviors in explosive percolation are rather clean and obey the standard finite-size scaling theory, except for the large fluctuation of pseudo-critical points. In the fluctuation window, multiple fractal structures emerge and the values can be derived from a crossover scaling theory. Further, their mixing effects account well for the previously observed anomalous phenomena. Making use of the clean scaling in the event-based ensemble, we determine with a high precision the critical points and exponents for a number of bond-insertion rules and clarify ambiguities about their universalities. Our findings hold true for any spatial dimensions.","The authors acknowledge helpful discussions with Peter Grassberger, Jingfang Fan, and Sheng Fang.

We intended to investigate the age and sex differences of cortical morphology in middle-aged and older adults and their relationships with the decline of cognitive function.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we examined the cortical morphology in 204 healthy middle-aged and older adult participants aged 45 to 89 years using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data from the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study data set. Brain cortical thickness, surface complexity, and gyrification index were analyzed through a completely automated surface-based morphometric analysis using the CAT12 toolbox. Furthermore, we explored the correlation between cortical morphology differences and test scores for processing speed and working memory.
Results: There were no significant interactions of age and sex with cortical thickness, fractal dimension, or gyrification index. Rather, we found that both males and females showed age-related decreases in cortical thickness, fractal dimension, and gyrification index. There were significant sex differences in the fractal dimension in middle-aged participants and the gyrification index in older adult participants. In addition, there were significant positive correlations between the cortical thickness of the right superior frontal gyrus and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III Letter-Number Sequencing test scores in males (r=0.394; P<0.001; 95% CI for r values 0.216-0.577) and females (r=0.344; P<0.001; 95% CI for r values 0.197-0.491), respectively. Furthermore, a significant relationship between the gyrification index of the right supramarginal gyrus (SupraMG) and WAIS-III Digit Symbol test scores was observed in older adult participants (r=0.375; P<0.001; 95% CI for r values 0.203-0.522).
Conclusions: The results suggest that, compared with males, females have more extensive differences in cortical morphology. The gyrification index of the right SupraMG can be used as an imaging marker of sexual cognitive differences between males and females in older adults. This study helps to further understand sex differences in the aging of the brain and cognition.",The authors are very grateful to the owner of the DLBS data set and the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative Group for sharing this data publicly.

The transformation and migration of organics in coal are essential to pore development under the action of microorganisms. Here, the biodegradation of bituminous coal and lignite to produce methane and the cultivation with inhibition of methanogenic activity by 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) were performed to analyze the effect of biodegradation on coal pore development by determining the changes of the pore structure and the organics in culture solution and coal. The results showed that the maximum methane productions from bituminous coal and lignite were 117.69 μmol/g and 166.55 μmol/g, respectively. Biodegradation mainly affected the development of micropore whose specific surface area (SSA) and pore volume (PV) decreased while the fractal dimension increased. After biodegradation, various organics were generated which were partly released into culture solution while a large number of them remained in residual coal. The content of newly generated heterocyclic organics and oxygen-containing aromatics in bituminous coal was 11.21% and 20.21%. And the content of heterocyclic organics in bituminous coal was negatively correlated with SSA and PV but positively correlated with the fractal dimension which suggested that the retention of organics contributed greatly to the decrease of pore development. But the retention effect on pore structure was relatively poor in lignite. Besides, microorganisms were observed around fissures in both coal samples after biodegradation which would not be conducive to the porosity of coal on the micron scale. These results revealed that the effect of biodegradation on pore development of coal was governed by the combined action of organics degradation to produce methane and organics retention in coal whose contributions were antagonistic and determined by coal rank and pore aperture. The better development of MECBM needs to enhance organics biodegradation and reduce organics retention in coal.",,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1810103, 51404163), Key R&D program of Shanxi Province (International Cooperation, 201903D421088), and coal seam gas Joint Foundation of Shanxi (2014012006).",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,"Coal; Biodegradation, Environmental; Methane",2023-06-19,2023,2023-06-19,2023-07,30,34,82834-82850,,,"Feng, Xiao; Zhang, Panpan; Zhang, Zizhong; Guo, Hongguang; Li, Zhigang; Huang, Zaixing; Urynowicz, Michael; Ali, Muhammad Ishtiaq","Feng, Xiao (College of Safety and Emergency Management and Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, 030024, Taiyuan, China; Key Laboratory of In-Situ Property-Improving Mining of Ministry of Education, Taiyuan University of Technology, 030024, Taiyuan, China); Zhang, Panpan (College of Safety and Emergency Management and Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, 030024, Taiyuan, China; Key Laboratory of In-Situ Property-Improving Mining of Ministry of Education, Taiyuan University of Technology, 030024, Taiyuan, China); Zhang, Zizhong (College of Safety and Emergency Management and Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, 030024, Taiyuan, China; Key Laboratory of In-Situ Property-Improving Mining of Ministry of Education, Taiyuan University of Technology, 030024, Taiyuan, China); Guo, Hongguang (College of Safety and Emergency Management and Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, 030024, Taiyuan, China; Key Laboratory of In-Situ Property-Improving Mining of Ministry of Education, Taiyuan University of Technology, 030024, Taiyuan, China); Li, Zhigang (College of Safety and Emergency Management and Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, 030024, Taiyuan, China; Key Laboratory of In-Situ Property-Improving Mining of Ministry of Education, Taiyuan University of Technology, 030024, Taiyuan, China); Huang, Zaixing (School of Chemical Engineering Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, 221116, Xuzhou, China); Urynowicz, Michael (Department of Civil & Architectural Engineering, University of Wyoming, 82071, Laramie, WY, USA); Ali, Muhammad Ishtiaq (Environmental Microbiology Lab, Department of Microbiology, Quaid-I-Azam University, 45320, Islamabad, Pakistan)","Guo, Hongguang (Taiyuan University of Technology; Taiyuan University of Technology)","Feng, Xiao (Taiyuan University of Technology; Taiyuan University of Technology); Zhang, Panpan (Taiyuan University of Technology; Taiyuan University of Technology); Zhang, Zizhong (Taiyuan University of Technology; Taiyuan University of Technology); Guo, Hongguang (Taiyuan University of Technology; Taiyuan University of Technology); Li, Zhigang (Taiyuan University of Technology; Taiyuan University of Technology); Huang, Zaixing (China University of Mining and Technology); Urynowicz, Michael (University of Wyoming); Ali, Muhammad Ishtiaq (Quaid-i-Azam University)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159932397,34 Chemical Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

With Qiandongnan argillaceous slate in Guizhou Province as the research object, the parameters for numerical simulation were determined through indoor uniaxial tests, and argillaceous slate models with different mineral contents were established to analyze crack formation and energy conversion during uniaxial compression. The damage rate of the specimen was qualitatively analyzed by the fractal dimension of the crack. The results show that ① the number of fractures increases with the increase of quartz content, and the number of cracks in Group 4 is 33.4% higher than that in Group 1, and macroscopic fractures are dominated by cracks while microscopic fractures by tension fractures, accompanied by a small amount of shear; ② the energy change curves of the four groups of specimens are consistent with the stress-strain curves, which are divided into three stages, namely elastic deformation, yield, and strength loss. The strain energy in the strength loss stage is negatively correlated with the dissipated energy, and the dissipated energy of the four groups of specimens is positively correlated with the content of quartz; ③ the damage rates for the specimens in Groups 1 to 4 quantitatively analyzed using fracture fractal dimension are 56.8, 59.1, 65.8, and 70.7%, respectively.

Since the chlorophyll content and the soil–plant analysis development (SPAD) value are positively correlated, it is feasible to predict the SPAD value by calculating the vegetation indices (VIs) through hyperspectral images, thereby evaluating the severity of plant diseases. However, current indices simply adopt few wavelengths of the hyperspectral information, which may decrease the prediction accuracy. Besides, few researches explored the applicability of VIs over rice under the bacterial blight disease stress.MethodsIn this study, the SPAD value was predicted by calculating the spectral fractal dimension index (SFDI) from a hyperspectral curve (420 to 950 nm). The correlation between the SPAD value and hyperspectral information was further analyzed for determining the sensitive bands that correspond to different disease levels. In addition, a SPAD prediction model was built upon the combination of selected indices and four machine learning methods.ResultsThe results suggested that the SPAD value of rice leaves under different disease levels are sensitive to different wavelengths. Compared with current VIs, a stronger positive correlation was detected between the SPAD value and the SFDI, reaching an average correlation coefficient of 0.8263. For the prediction model, the one built with support vector regression and SFDI achieved the best performance, reaching R2, RMSE, and RE at 0.8752, 3.7715, and 7.8614%, respectively.ConclusionsThis work provides an in-depth insight for accurately and robustly predicting the SPAD value of rice leaves under the bacterial blight disease stress, and the SFDI is of great significance for monitoring the chlorophyll content in large-scale fields non-destructively.",We thank the College of Plant Protection of Nanjing Agricultural University for providing the experiment materials.,"The research leading to the presented results has been undertaken within the Startup Foundation of New Professor at Nanjing Agricultural University (Grant No. 106-804005), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61502236), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant Nos.

To investigate the dynamic tensile failure process of coal subjected to impact loading, this study used high-speed photography and digital image correlation technology to capture the dynamic tensile failure of coal under impact loading. The dynamic tensile evolution was quantitatively analyzed from the beginning of coal sample being loaded to failure. The captured images of the coal were processed, and the fractal dimension was used to quantitatively describe the evolution of the coal surface cracks under impact loading. The following conclusions were drawn from the experimental results: (1) An empirical formula was established to describe the dynamic tensile strength characteristics of coal under different loading rates. (2) Under impact loading, the maximum strain of a Brazilian disc coal sample first appeared at the contact end between the sample and the incident rod. (3) Under impact loading, a Brazilian disc coal sample cracked from the center of the sample outward, and the crack subsequently extended toward both ends. The fractal dimension of the crack exhibited a power function relationship with time, and the variation range of the fractal dimension of the crack was 1.05–1.39.","The work carried out in this study was supported by Hubei Natural Science Foundation Innovation and Development Joint Fund Key Project (Grant No. 2022CFD009), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52074112), the National Natural Science Foundation Cultivation Project (Grant No. 2022pygpzk08), Provincial College Students’ Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program (Grant No. S202310519033), Hubei Superior and Distinctive Discipline Group of “New Energy Vehicle and Smart Transportation”.",,Scientific Reports,,,,2024-06-10,2024,2024-06-10,,14,1,13283,,,"Wang, Ziping; Li, Shengwei; Zhang, Yi; Qi, Peiwen; Zhang, Youyou; Chen, Yuanjing; Li, Yexue; Zeng, Gang","Wang, Ziping (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Hubei University of Arts and Science, 441053, Xiangyang, Hubei, China); Li, Shengwei (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Hubei University of Arts and Science, 441053, Xiangyang, Hubei, China; State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, College of Water Resources and Hydropower, Sichuan University, 610065, Chengdu, China); Zhang, Yi (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Hubei University of Arts and Science, 441053, Xiangyang, Hubei, China); Qi, Peiwen (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Hubei University of Arts and Science, 441053, Xiangyang, Hubei, China); Zhang, Youyou (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Hubei University of Arts and Science, 441053, Xiangyang, Hubei, China); Chen, Yuanjing (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Hubei University of Arts and Science, 441053, Xiangyang, Hubei, China); Li, Yexue (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Hubei University of Arts and Science, 441053, Xiangyang, Hubei, China); Zeng, Gang (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Hubei University of Arts and Science, 441053, Xiangyang, Hubei, China)","Li, Shengwei (Hubei University of Arts and Science; Sichuan University)","Wang, Ziping (Hubei University of Arts and Science); Li, Shengwei (Hubei University of Arts and Science; Sichuan University); Zhang, Yi (Hubei University of Arts and Science); Qi, Peiwen (Hubei University of Arts and Science); Zhang, Youyou (Hubei University of Arts and Science); Chen, Yuanjing (Hubei University of Arts and Science); Li, Yexue (Hubei University of Arts and Science); Zeng, Gang (Hubei University of Arts and Science)",0,0,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64342-8,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172677058,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Aside from using a constant sticking probability, the sticking probability was allowed to depend on the masses of the colliding clusters and on the number of particles close to the collision between clusters. The different models of the sticking probability were evaluated based on the goodness-of-fit of spatial summary statistics. Furthermore, the models were compared to the experimental data by calculating the structures' fractal dimension and mass transport properties from simulations of flow and diffusion.

However, most hydrophobic surfaces of Si are primarily achieved through microtexturing with subsequent coating or modification of low surface energy materials. The coatings make the hydrophobic surface unstable and impractical in many industrial applications. In this work, the Si chips’ wettability transitions are yielded from the original hydrophilic state to a stable transitional hydrophobic state by texturing bamboo-leaf-like hierarchical structures (BLHSs) through a diamond grinding wheel with one-step forming. Experiments showed that the contact angles (CAs) on the BLHS surfaces increased to 97° and only reduced by 2% after droplet impacts. This is unmatched by the current texturing surface without modification. Moreover, the droplets can be split up and transferred by the BLHS surfaces with their 100% mass. When the BLHS surfaces are modified by the low surface energy materials’ coating, the hydrophobic BLHS surfaces are upgraded to be superhydrophobic (CA > 135°). More interestingly, the droplet can be completely self-sucked into a hollow micro-tube within 0.1 s without applying external forces. A new wetting model for BLHS surfaces based on the fractal theory is determined by comparing simulated values with the measured static contact angle of the droplets. The successful preparation of the bamboo-leaf-like Si confirmed that transitional wettability surfaces could be achieved by the micromachining of grinding on the hard and brittle materials.

Dendrites on wetting (hydrophilic) and nonwetting (hydrophobic) surfaces are sharp, pointy, branching, and hairy. Here, we show a unique dendrite morphology on state-of-the-art micro/nanostructured oil-impregnated surfaces, which are commonly referred to as slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces or liquid-infused surfaces. Unlike the dendrites on traditional textured hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, the dendrites on oil-impregnated surfaces are thick and lumpy without pattern. Our experiments show that the unique ice dendrite morphology on lubricant-infused surfaces is due to oil wicking into the porous dendritic network because of the capillary pressure imbalance between the surface texture and the dendrites. We characterized the shape complexity of the ice dendrites using fractal analysis. Experiments show that ice dendrites on textured oil-impregnated surfaces have lower fractal dimensions than those on traditional lotus leaf-inspired air-filled porous structures. Furthermore, we developed a regime map that can be used as a design guideline for micro/nanostructured oil-impregnated surfaces by capturing the complex effects of oil chemistry, oil viscosity, and wetting ridge volume on dendrite growth and morphology. The insights gained from this work inform strategies to reduce lubricant depletion, a major bottleneck for the transition of micro/nanostructured oil-impregnated surfaces from bench-top laboratory prototypes to industrial use. This work will assist the development of next-generation depletion-resistant lubricant-infused ice-repellent surfaces.",We would like to thank the Lurie Nanofabrication Facility and the Michigan Center for Material Characterization for training and staff support.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The study involved 120 people without structural changes in the brain (age 18-86 years, 55 men and 65 women). T1- and T2-weighted MR brain images were studied. Fractal analysis was performed using box counting and pixel dilatation methods. Fractal dimensions of cerebellar tissue as a whole, cerebellar cortex and its individual layers, cerebellar white matter were measured and compared to each other and to fractal dimension of cerebellar white matter determined in cadaveric cerebella.
RESULTS: Results: It was no significant difference between fractal dimension values of cerebellar tissue as a whole measured on T1 and T2 weighted magnetic resonance images of cerebellum, and fractal dimension values measured on the same images using different methods of fractal analysis - pixel dilatation and box counting. T2 weighted images are preferable for fractal analysis of different components of cerebellar tissue. Segmentation according to pixel luminance is the preferable image preprocessing method for fractal analysis of cerebellar cortex as a whole, individual cortical layers and cerebellar tissue as a whole; skeletonizing of cerebellar magnetic resonance images is the preferable method of the image preprocessing for fractal analysis of cerebellar white matter.

Researchers often attribute reef ecological processes to corals' complex structure, but effective conservation requires disentangling the contributions of coral versus reef structures. Many studies assessing the relationships between reef structure and ecological dynamics commonly use live coral as a proxy for reef complexity, disregarding the contribution of dead coral skeletons to reef habitat provision or other biogeochemical reef dynamics. This study aimed to assess the contribution of dead coral to reef complexity by examining structural variations in live and dead Acropora palmata colonies. We used photogrammetry to reconstruct digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthomosaics of the benthic region immediately surrounding 10 A. palmata colonies. These reconstructions were used to quantify structural metrics, including surface rugosity, fractal dimension, slope, planform curvature, and profile curvature, as a function of benthic composition (i.e., live A. palmata, dead A. palmata, or non-A. palmata substrate). The results revealed that dead coral maintained more varied profile curvatures and higher fractal dimensions than live or non-coral substrate. Conversely, A. palmata colonies with a higher proportion of live coral displayed more uniform structure, with lower fractal dimensions and less variability in profile curvature measures. Other metrics showed no significant difference among substrate types. These findings provide novel insights into the structural differences between live and dead coral, and an alternative perspective on the mechanisms driving the observed structural complexity on reefs. Overall, our results highlight the overlooked potential contributions of dead coral to reef habitat provision, ecological processes, and other biogeochemical reef dynamics, and could have important implications for coral reef conservation.","We thank Dr. Valerie Paul, the Smithsonian Marine Station Staff, and the FSU Biological Science IT staff for their support on this project.

However, data on the association between both retinal vascular and neuronal parameters with cortical cerebral microinfarcts (CMIs) and how these factors jointly influence cognition are lacking.
AIM: We investigated the association of retinal vascular and neuronal changes with CMIs on 3 T MRI and explored their interaction with cognitive impairment in a memory-clinic population.
METHODS: A total of 538 participants were included. Retinal vascular parameters (caliber, tortuosity, and fractal dimension) were measured from retinal fundus photographs using a semi-automated computer-assisted program. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thicknesses were obtained from optical coherence tomography. Cortical CMIs were defined as hypointense on T1-weighted MRI, <5 mm in diameter and restricted to the cortex. Cognition was assessed using Clinical Dementia Rating Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SoB) score and detailed neuropsychological test. Multivariable regression analysis was conducted adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, diagnosis, white matter hyperintensities volume, lacunes, and cerebral microbleeds.
RESULTS: Larger venular caliber (Rate ratios (RR): 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.38, p = 0.014), increased venular fractal dimension (RR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.31-1.91, p ⩽ 0.001), increased venular tortuosity (RR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.35-1.75, p ⩽ 0.001), and thinner GC-IPL (RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.13-1.36, p ⩽ 0.001) were associated with CMI counts. Among individuals in highest tertile of retinal parameters, a significant interaction was observed between venular tortuosity (RR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02-1.22, p-interaction = 0.014) and GC-IPL (RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11, p-interaction < 0.001) with CMIs on CDR-SoB.
CONCLUSION: Retinal vascular and neuronal parameters are associated with cortical CMIs, and persons with both pathologies are likely to have cognitive impairment. Further studies may be warranted to evaluate the clinical utility of retinal parameters and CMI in risk prediction for cognitive dysfunction.",,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Singapore National Medical Research Council (grant nos.

The symptoms caused by this physiological disorder have been commonly evaluated by visual inspection at a macro-observation scale on fruit surface; however, the structure at deeper scales is also affected by CI. This work aimed to propose a descriptive model of the CI development in tomato tissue under the micro-scale, micro-nano-scale and nano-scale approaches using fractal analysis. For that, quality and fractal parameters were determined. In this sense, light microscopy, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were applied to analyse micro-, micro-nano- and nano-scales, respectively. Results showed that the morphology of tomato tissue at the micro-scale level was properly described by the multifractal behaviour. Also, generalised fractal dimension (Dq=0) and texture fractal dimension (FD) of CI-damaged pericarp and cuticle were higher (1.659, 1.601 and 1.746, respectively) in comparison to non-chilled samples (1.606, 1.578 and 1.644, respectively); however, FD was unsuitable to detect morphological changes at the nano-scale. On the other hand, lacunarity represented an appropriate fractal parameter to detect CI symptoms at the nano-scale due to differences observed between damaged and regular ripe tissue (0.044 and 0.025, respectively). The proposed multi-scale approach could improve the understanding of CI as a complex disorder to the development of novel techniques to avoid this postharvest issue at different observation scales.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between fracture toughness and fractal dimensional increment of two dental glass-ceramics with different volume fraction of crystals and different fracture surface roughness.
METHODS: Bar-shaped specimens were prepared from lithium disilicate (LDS) and nanofluorapatite (NFA) glass-ceramics. One face of each specimen was indented using a Knoop diamond at 25 N (LDS) or 10 N (NFA) followed by loading in 4-point, or 3-point flexure, respectively, until failure. Fracture toughness (Kc) was calculated using the surface crack in flexure (SCF) technique (ASTM C1421). Epoxy replicas of the fracture surfaces were scanned using the atomic force microscope (AFM) followed by noise filtering. The FRACTALS software was used to determine the fractal dimensional increment (D*) by the Minkowski cover algorithm.
RESULTS: Median (25%, 75% quartiles) fracture toughness of LDS bars were 1.62 (1.59, 1.69) MPa m1/2 and NFA bars were 0.68 (0.66, 0.74) MPa m1/2, respectively. The median fractal dimension (D) value (25%, 75% quartiles) before noise filtering were 2.16 (2.15, 2.17) and after noise filtering were 2.14 (2.14, 2.15) for LDS and before noise filtering were 2.29 (2.21, 2.38) and after noise filtering were 2.17 (2.17, 2.18) for NFA. Median (25%, 75% quartiles) surface roughness (Ra) before noise filtering were 139 (119, 188) nm and after noise filtering were 137 (118, 187) nm for LDS and before noise filtering were 7 (6, 15) nm and after noise filtering were 7 (6, 15) nm for NFA.
SIGNIFICANCE: Noise filtering successfully eliminated noise from the material with smooth fracture surfaces (NFA), decreasing the measured fractal dimension. The NFA data fit a Kc vs. D*1/2 statistical model for fused silica previously tested using a similar technique. The equation relating fracture toughness to the fractal dimension was modified, accounting for the toughening mechanisms. Fractal analysis with noise filtering can be used to estimate the fracture toughness of dental glass-ceramics that do not exhibit crack bridging.",The authors appreciated advice from Dr. Jared S.

METHODS: Thirty-three healthy subjects were enrolled. The ONH of both eyes were imaged four times by a swept-source-OCTA using a 3 mm ×3 mm scanning protocol. Images of the radial peripapillary capillary were analyzed by a customized Matlab program, and the vessel density, fractal dimension, and vessel diameter index were measured. The repeatability of the four scans was determined by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The most well-centered optic disc from the four repeated scans was then selected for the interocular correlation and agreement analysis using the Pearson correlation coefficient, ICC and Bland-Altman plots.
RESULTS: All swept-source-OCTA ONH parameters exhibited certain repeatability, with ICC>0.760 and coefficient of variation (CoV)≤7.301%. The obvious interocular correlation was observed for papillary vessel density (ICC=0.857), vessel diameter index (ICC=0.857) and fractal dimension (ICC=0.906), while circumpapillary vessel density exhibited moderate interocular correlation (ICC=0.687). Bland-Altman plots revealed an agreement range of -5.26% to 6.21% for circumpapillary vessel density.
CONCLUSION: OCTA ONH parameters demonstrate good repeatability in healthy subjects. The interocular correlations of papillary vessel density, fractal dimension and vessel diameter index are high, but the correlation for circumpapillary vessel density is moderate.",,,International Journal of Ophthalmology,,,,2024-05-18,2024,2024-05-18,2024-05-18,17,5,896-903,,,"Fang, Dan-Qi; Yang, Da-Wei; Mai, Xiao-Ting; Cheung, Carol Y; Chen, Hao-Yu","Fang, Dan-Qi (Joint Shantou International Eye Center, Shantou University & the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shantou 515041, Guangdong Province, China.); Yang, Da-Wei (Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 999077, China.); Mai, Xiao-Ting (Joint Shantou International Eye Center, Shantou University & the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shantou 515041, Guangdong Province, China.); Cheung, Carol Y (Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 999077, China.); Chen, Hao-Yu (Joint Shantou International Eye Center, Shantou University & the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shantou 515041, Guangdong Province, China.)",,"Fang, Dan-Qi (Shantou University); Yang, Da-Wei (Chinese University of Hong Kong); Mai, Xiao-Ting (Shantou University); Cheung, Carol Y (Chinese University of Hong Kong); Chen, Hao-Yu (Shantou University)",0,0,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.18240/ijo.2024.05.14,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171029741,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,

However, when machining NHCs to obtain a thin-edged surface, some problems can arise due to large cutting forces. To avoid these defects, a method of ultrasonic vibration machining with variable angles of the down milling disc cutter was proposed in this study. The processing principles and motion characteristics of this method were elaborated. A theoretical model of its cutting process was established. The principle of cutting force reduction was qualitatively analyzed based on the model, and an experimental validation was conducted. The results demonstrated that, due to a smaller swing angle in each pass, the proposed method could reduce the fractal dimension of the machined surface by 6.01% compared to 1° with 10° of angle in each pass. And severe machining defects were decreased. Additionally, comparing the process of the fixed 10° angle of ultrasonic vibration machining with the process of a 1° angle in a pass, cutting force can be significantly reduced by 33.5%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method which improved surface quality by reducing cutting forces.","The authors would like to thank Shenzhen Tsingding Technology Co., Ltd. and Xiamen Tungsten Co., Ltd. for their technical supports.","This research was funded by Shenzhen Science and Technology Program under Grant No. JSGG20210802154405017, Shenzhen Foundational Research Project (General program) under Grant No. JCYJ20190813173607172, Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province under Grant No. 2022J05280, and Scientific Research Start-up Project of Xiamen University of Technology under Grant No. YKJ22015R.",Materials,,,,2023-08-13,2023,2023-08-13,,16,16,5611,,,"Yuan, Xinman; Zhang, Kexin; Zha, Huiting; Xu, Jie; Song, Ge; Cao, Wenjun; Feng, Pingfa; Feng, Feng","Yuan, Xinman (AVIC Chengdu Aircraft Industrial (Group) Co., Ltd., Chengdu 610073, China;, yz880417@163.com, (X.Y.);, rommel_sg@163.com, (G.S.);, 13678026768@163.com, (W.C.)); Zhang, Kexin (Division of Advanced Manufacturing, Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China;, zhang-kx21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, (K.Z.);, xu-j22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, (J.X.);, feng.pingfa@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn, (P.F.)); Zha, Huiting (Division of Advanced Manufacturing, Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China;, zhang-kx21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, (K.Z.);, xu-j22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, (J.X.);, feng.pingfa@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn, (P.F.); School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen 361024, China); Xu, Jie (Division of Advanced Manufacturing, Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China;, zhang-kx21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, (K.Z.);, xu-j22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, (J.X.);, feng.pingfa@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn, (P.F.)); Song, Ge (AVIC Chengdu Aircraft Industrial (Group) Co., Ltd., Chengdu 610073, China;, yz880417@163.com, (X.Y.);, rommel_sg@163.com, (G.S.);, 13678026768@163.com, (W.C.)); Cao, Wenjun (AVIC Chengdu Aircraft Industrial (Group) Co., Ltd., Chengdu 610073, China;, yz880417@163.com, (X.Y.);, rommel_sg@163.com, (G.S.);, 13678026768@163.com, (W.C.)); Feng, Pingfa (Division of Advanced Manufacturing, Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China;, zhang-kx21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, (K.Z.);, xu-j22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, (J.X.);, feng.pingfa@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn, (P.F.)); Feng, Feng (Division of Advanced Manufacturing, Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen 518055, China;, zhang-kx21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, (K.Z.);, xu-j22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, (J.X.);, feng.pingfa@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn, (P.F.))","Zha, Huiting (Tsinghua University; Xiamen University of Technology); Feng, Feng (Tsinghua University)","Yuan, Xinman (Aviation Industry Corporation of China (China)); Zhang, Kexin (Tsinghua University); Zha, Huiting (Tsinghua University; Xiamen University of Technology); Xu, Jie (Tsinghua University); Song, Ge (Aviation Industry Corporation of China (China)); Cao, Wenjun (Aviation Industry Corporation of China (China)); Feng, Pingfa (Tsinghua University); Feng, Feng (Tsinghua University)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/16/5611/pdf?version=1691928183,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163285711,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,

To solve this problem, this paper proposes an original mortar replacement (M) method to reuse waste solids and reduce cement consumption. In the experiment, the author employed an M method which replaces water, cement, and sand with WITP under constant water/cement and found that the strength development can be significantly improved. Specifically, a mortar with 20% WITP replacement can obtain a 30.95% improvement in strength development. To study the internal mechanism, we performed experiments such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and SEM. The results demonstrate that the nucleation effect and pozzolanic effect of WITP can help promote cement hydration, and MIP reveals that WITP can effectively optimize pore structure. In addition, 1 kg 20% WITP mortar reduced cement consumption by 20%, which saves 19.98% of the economic cost. Comprehensively, our approach achieves the effective utilization of WITP and provides a favorable reference for practical engineering.","This study include National Natural Science Foundation of China (52008003), Special Project on Science and Technology of Anhui Province (202003a07020023), Key Project of Natural Science Research in Universities of Anhui Province (KJ2020ZD33), Key Research and Development Program Project of Anhui Province (201904a07020081), Research Foundation of the Institute of Environment-friendly Materials and Occupational Health (Wuhu), Anhui University of Science and Technology (ALW2020YF16).

It is important for the clinician to fully understand the mechanical properties and behavior of the appliance used. Because of that, the aim of our study was to investigate the changes in aligner surface after immersion in Coca-Cola and orange juice. For surface evaluation, fractal analysis, texture analysis, and wetting angle measurement were performed. Statistically significant changes were found between some of the groups in the fractal dimension analysis. In texture analysis, all but one intergroup comparison showed statistically significant differences. For wetting angle assessment, statistically significant differences were found. These were, however, more numerous when assessing glycol droplets, rather than water droplets. Fractal dimension analysis confirmed a correlation between the intensity of changes in the aligner surface with immersion time in the liquids assessed. Texture analysis showed a high sensitivity to the changes in aligner surface. It failed, however, to reveal changes relative to immersion time. Wetting angle analysis revealed aligner surface degradation for Coca-Cola. It did not, however, prove the dependence of the intensity of this degradation as a function of time.

In this study, a series of granite specimens (a total of 60) with different aspect ratios were dynamically loaded by a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) to explain the energy dissipation and the rock-crushing degree under dynamic load. A new index, namely energy time density (wtd), is proposed to evaluate the energy dissipation considering the time factor. The relationships between strain rate, energy time density, and specific energy absorption are analyzed. A metric (Ku) is defined to describe the degree of rock fragmentation quantitatively. The correlations of fractal dimension and Ku with different impact pressures are compared. It was concluded that there is a noticeable peak point in the energy time density curve. The energy time density of the stress equilibrium point is three times that of the peak point. The energy time density declines after the peak point, then the energy consumption density tends to be stable. The linear relationship between strain rate and peak point energy time density is stronger. The new index can describe energy dissipation well under dynamic loading. In addition, the experimental results indicate that the degree of crush Ku can describe the degree of crush, and the effect of fractal dimension to quantify the fracture characteristics of the rocks is less good in this test. The crushing degree of rocks increases with the increase of strain rate. Furthermore, the prediction effect of energy time density is better than that of strain rate about Ku.",,"This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51974187), Foundation for University Key Teacher by University of Science and Technology Liaoning (Grant No. 601011507-25), and Educational Commission of Liaoning Province of China (Grant No. LJKZ0282), its support is gratefully appreciated.",Materials,,,,2022-02-15,2022,2022-02-15,,15,4,1443,,,"Wang, Xuesong; Guo, Lianjun; Xu, Zhenyang; Wang, Junxiang; Deng, Ding; Xu, Jinglong; Hu, Zhihang","Wang, Xuesong (School of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China;, wangxs@smail.sut.edu.cn, (X.W.);, w.j.x.good@163.com, (J.W.);, dingdeng@smail.sut.edu.cn, (D.D.);, xjl1306575661@foxmail.com, (J.X.)); Guo, Lianjun (School of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China;, wangxs@smail.sut.edu.cn, (X.W.);, w.j.x.good@163.com, (J.W.);, dingdeng@smail.sut.edu.cn, (D.D.);, xjl1306575661@foxmail.com, (J.X.)); Xu, Zhenyang (College of Mining Engineering, University of Science and Technology Liaoning, Anshan 114051, China;, xuzhenyang10@foxmail.com, (Z.X.);, huzhihang123@foxmail.com, (Z.H.)); Wang, Junxiang (School of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China;, wangxs@smail.sut.edu.cn, (X.W.);, w.j.x.good@163.com, (J.W.);, dingdeng@smail.sut.edu.cn, (D.D.);, xjl1306575661@foxmail.com, (J.X.)); Deng, Ding (School of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China;, wangxs@smail.sut.edu.cn, (X.W.);, w.j.x.good@163.com, (J.W.);, dingdeng@smail.sut.edu.cn, (D.D.);, xjl1306575661@foxmail.com, (J.X.)); Xu, Jinglong (School of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China;, wangxs@smail.sut.edu.cn, (X.W.);, w.j.x.good@163.com, (J.W.);, dingdeng@smail.sut.edu.cn, (D.D.);, xjl1306575661@foxmail.com, (J.X.)); Hu, Zhihang (College of Mining Engineering, University of Science and Technology Liaoning, Anshan 114051, China;, xuzhenyang10@foxmail.com, (Z.X.);, huzhihang123@foxmail.com, (Z.H.); Chengyuan Mining Development Co., Ltd., Liaoyang 111299, China)","Guo, Lianjun (Shenyang University of Technology; School of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China;, wangxs@smail.sut.edu.cn, (X.W.);, w.j.x.good@163.com, (J.W.);, dingdeng@smail.sut.edu.cn, (D.D.);, xjl1306575661@foxmail.com, (J.X.))","Wang, Xuesong (Shenyang University of Technology; School of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China;, wangxs@smail.sut.edu.cn, (X.W.);, w.j.x.good@163.com, (J.W.);, dingdeng@smail.sut.edu.cn, (D.D.);, xjl1306575661@foxmail.com, (J.X.)); Guo, Lianjun (Shenyang University of Technology; School of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China;, wangxs@smail.sut.edu.cn, (X.W.);, w.j.x.good@163.com, (J.W.);, dingdeng@smail.sut.edu.cn, (D.D.);, xjl1306575661@foxmail.com, (J.X.)); Xu, Zhenyang (University of Science and Technology Liaoning); Wang, Junxiang (Shenyang University of Technology; School of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China;, wangxs@smail.sut.edu.cn, (X.W.);, w.j.x.good@163.com, (J.W.);, dingdeng@smail.sut.edu.cn, (D.D.);, xjl1306575661@foxmail.com, (J.X.)); Deng, Ding (Shenyang University of Technology; School of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China;, wangxs@smail.sut.edu.cn, (X.W.);, w.j.x.good@163.com, (J.W.);, dingdeng@smail.sut.edu.cn, (D.D.);, xjl1306575661@foxmail.com, (J.X.)); Xu, Jinglong (Shenyang University of Technology; School of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang 110870, China;, wangxs@smail.sut.edu.cn, (X.W.);, w.j.x.good@163.com, (J.W.);, dingdeng@smail.sut.edu.cn, (D.D.);, xjl1306575661@foxmail.com, (J.X.)); Hu, Zhihang (University of Science and Technology Liaoning; Chengyuan Mining Development Co., Ltd., Liaoyang 111299, China)",3,3,,1.38,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/4/1443/pdf?version=1644921607,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145622068,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

To this end, computed tomography (CT) was performed to quantify the changes in the microstructure of yellow sandstone after freeze-thaw (F-T) action. On this basis, the influence of the microscopic parameters on the dynamic mechanical behavior was studied. The results showed that the strain rate enhanced the dynamic mechanical properties, but the F-T-induced decrease in strength and elastic modulus increased with increasing strain rate. After 40 F-T cycles, the dynamic strength of the samples increased by 41% to 75.6 MPa when the strain rate was increased from 75 to 115 s-1, which is 2.5 times the static strength. Moreover, the dynamic strength and elastic modulus of the sample were linearly and negatively correlated with the fractal dimension and porosity, with the largest decrease rate at 115 s-1, indicating that the microscopic parameters have a crucial influence on dynamic mechanical behavior. When the fractal dimension was increased from 2.56 to 2.67, the dynamic peak strength of the samples under the three impact loads decreased by 43.7 MPa (75 s), 61.8 MPa (95 s), and 71.4 MPa (115 s), respectively. In addition, a damage evolution model under F-T and impact loading was developed considering porosity variation. It was found that the damage development in the sample was highly related to the strain rate and F-T damage. As the strain rate increases, the strain required for damage development gradually decreases with a lower increase rate. In contrast, the strain required for damage development in the sample increases with increasing F-T damage. The research results can be a reference for constructing and maintaining rock structures in cold regions.",,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51974296, No. 52061135111).",Materials,,,,2022-12-22,2022,2022-12-22,,16,1,119,,,"Xu, Junce; Pu, Hai; Sha, Ziheng","Xu, Junce (State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China); Pu, Hai (State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China; College of Mining Engineering and Geology, Xinjiang Institute of Engineering, Urumqi 830091, China); Sha, Ziheng (State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China)","Pu, Hai (China University of Mining and Technology; Xinjiang Institute of Engineering)","Xu, Junce (China University of Mining and Technology); Pu, Hai (China University of Mining and Technology; Xinjiang Institute of Engineering); Sha, Ziheng (China University of Mining and Technology)",1,1,,0.31,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/1/119/pdf?version=1672130924,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153951262,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 40 Engineering,

In this study, the effect following orthodontic treatment with clear aligners and with conventional brackets, on the mandibular condyle trabecular bone formation is aimed to be examined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty two individuals (16 females and 16 males) with a mean age of 16.80 ± 3,10 years who received orthodontic treatment with clear aligners and conventional brackets were included in the study. Individuals included in the study from the archive data were divided into two groups according to treatment types. The mandibular condyle bone quality in the panoramic images taken from the patients before orthodontic treatment (T0) and after orthodontic treatment (T1) has been compared retrospectively. This examination is carried out via the fractal analysis method.
RESULT: The mandibular condyle bone density in individuals that have undergone orthodontic treatment with clear aligners, has been reduced following orthodontic treatment. In individuals that have undergone orthodontic treatment with conventional brackets however the mandibular condyle bone density has increased following treatment (T0) in comparison to before being treated (T1). The mandibular condyle bone density change according to different treatment groups has been found to be statistically different.
CONCLUSION: Orthodontic treatment with clear aligners provides several advantages to patients. However, besides determining the effectiveness of the treatment, complications must also be examined. Application of clear aligners in orthodontic treatment may cause a decrease in bone density in the mandibular condyle. When evaluating orthodontic treatments carried out with clear aligners, the change of the mandibular condyle head bone should be taken into consideration.",The authors would like to thank Abdullah Seckin Ertugrul for the assistance with statistical analyses.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Journal of Stomatology Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,,,"Female; Fractals; Humans; Male; Mandibular Condyle; Orthodontic Appliances, Removable; Radiography, Panoramic; Retrospective Studies",2022-06-08,2022,2022-06-08,2022-10,123,5,538-545,,,"Ertugrul, Betul Yuzbasioglu; Veli, İlknur","Ertugrul, Betul Yuzbasioglu (Izmir Demokrasi University Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Orthodontics, Izmir, Turkey.

These technologies have boosted the mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the human genome, providing a complex universe of heterogeneity characterizing individuals worldwide. Fractal dimension (FD) measures the degree of geometric irregularity, quantifying how ""complex"" a self-similar natural phenomenon is. We compared two FD algorithms, box-counting dimension (BCD) and Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD), to characterize genome-wide patterns of SNPs extracted from the HapMap data set, which includes data from 1184 healthy subjects of eleven populations. In addition, we have used cluster and classification analysis to relate the genetic distances within chromosomes based on FD similarities to the geographical distances among the 11 global populations. We found that HFD outperformed BCD at both grand average clusterization analysis by the cophenetic correlation coefficient, in which the closest value to 1 represents the most accurate clustering solution (0.981 for the HFD and 0.956 for the BCD) and classification (79.0% accuracy, 61.7% sensitivity, and 96.4% specificity for the HFD with respect to 69.1% accuracy, 43.2% sensitivity, and 94.9% specificity for the BCD) of the 11 populations present in the HapMap data set.

Even so, automated methods evaluating the seminiferous tubules to detect testicular damage are still scarce. In search of new approaches to automation in the microscopic analysis of the testis; the present study used the fractal dimension, lacunarity, multifractality and quantitative morphometry to quantify changes in microphotographs of the seminiferous lumen in testicles reversibly damaged by heat stress (43 °C, 12 min). The parameters fractal dimension, lacunarity, multifractality (Dq and α), perimeter, feret and circularity were able to detect changes in the seminiferous lumen at 7, 15 and 30 days after the testicular damage. These methods also detected the recovery of spermatogenesis at 60 days after heat stress. Area, f(α), centroid X and Y, roundness, rectangle height and width were unable to detect changes caused by heat stress. In conclusion, computer assisted methods applied to the seminiferous lumen images can be a useful new viewpoint to analyze microscopic changes in the testicles, a fast low-cost tool to assist in the automated quantification of testicular damage.",Conflict of interest The authors report no declarations of interest.,"This work was supported by the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil; Federal University of Paraíba, João Pessoa, Paraíba, Brazil and Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil.",Acta Histochemica,,,Fractals; Heat-Shock Response; Humans; Male; Seminiferous Tubules; Spermatogenesis; Testis,2022-08-22,2022,2022-08-22,2022-10,124,7,151949,,,"Melo, Isabel Oliveira; Angelo Mendes Tenorio, Fernanda das Chagas; da Silva Gomes, José Anderson; da Silva Junior, Valdemiro Amaro; de Albuquerque Nogueira, Romildo; Tenorio, Bruno Mendes","Melo, Isabel Oliveira (Health Sciences Center, Federal University of Paraíba, João Pessoa, Paraíba, Brazil.); Angelo Mendes Tenorio, Fernanda das Chagas (Department of Histology and Embryology, Bioscience Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil.); da Silva Gomes, José Anderson (Department of Histology and Embryology, Bioscience Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil.); da Silva Junior, Valdemiro Amaro (Department of Veterinary Medicine, Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil.); de Albuquerque Nogueira, Romildo (Department of Animal Morphology and Physiology, Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil.); Tenorio, Bruno Mendes (Department of Histology and Embryology, Bioscience Center, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil.

Brain dynamics were investigated to elucidate the complexity and connectivity of the brain. The alpha PSD increased in all brain areas during mindfulness in both weeks. For complexity, Fractal Dimension (FD) increased significantly during meditation in the week six recording. When comparing the FD in the mindfulness state of week four and week six, we also witnessed a significant increase in the following week. The coherence of the interhemispheric frontal and temporal regions increased significantly in both weeks. In conclusion, the subject successfully transferred from attention to mindfulness, demonstrated by the alpha changes when going from podcast to meditating.

According to the connection structure between fractures and pores, the permeability analysis model of fluids in a matrix-embedded fracture network is established. The comparison between the predicted values of the model and the experimental data shows that the predicted values of the permeability of the rough fracture network and the rough matrix pores decrease with the increase in the relative roughness of the fractures and matrix pores, and are lower than the experimental data. Meanwhile, the predicted total flow rate of a rough fractured dual porous media is lower than that of a smooth fractal model and experimental data. In addition, it is also found that the larger the average inclination angle and the relative roughness of the fracture network, the smaller the permeability of the fractured dual porous media, and the relative roughness of the fracture network has a far greater influence on fluid permeability in the fractured dual porous media than the relative roughness of the matrix pores.",The authors would like to thank the associate editors and anonymous reviewers for their numerous constructive comments that will improve the content of this paper.,This research was funded by the National NaturalScience Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51641606) and the Young Talents Project of Science and Technology Research Program of Hubei Education Department (No. Q20201210).,Materials,,,,2022-07-02,2022,2022-07-02,,15,13,4662,,,"Yang, Shanshan; Wang, Mengying; Zheng, Sheng; Zeng, Shuguang; Gao, Ling","Yang, Shanshan (Three Gorges Mathematical Research Center, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, 202107010021019@ctgu.edu.cn, (M.W.);, zsh@ctgu.edu.cn, (S.Z.);, ring024@126.com, (L.G.); College of Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, zengshuguang19@163.com); Wang, Mengying (Three Gorges Mathematical Research Center, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, 202107010021019@ctgu.edu.cn, (M.W.);, zsh@ctgu.edu.cn, (S.Z.);, ring024@126.com, (L.G.); College of Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, zengshuguang19@163.com); Zheng, Sheng (Three Gorges Mathematical Research Center, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, 202107010021019@ctgu.edu.cn, (M.W.);, zsh@ctgu.edu.cn, (S.Z.);, ring024@126.com, (L.G.); College of Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, zengshuguang19@163.com); Zeng, Shuguang (College of Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, zengshuguang19@163.com); Gao, Ling (Three Gorges Mathematical Research Center, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, 202107010021019@ctgu.edu.cn, (M.W.);, zsh@ctgu.edu.cn, (S.Z.);, ring024@126.com, (L.G.); College of Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, zengshuguang19@163.com)","Yang, Shanshan (China Three Gorges University; Three Gorges Mathematical Research Center, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, 202107010021019@ctgu.edu.cn, (M.W.);, zsh@ctgu.edu.cn, (S.Z.);, ring024@126.com, (L.G.); China Three Gorges University)","Yang, Shanshan (China Three Gorges University; Three Gorges Mathematical Research Center, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, 202107010021019@ctgu.edu.cn, (M.W.);, zsh@ctgu.edu.cn, (S.Z.);, ring024@126.com, (L.G.); China Three Gorges University); Wang, Mengying (China Three Gorges University; Three Gorges Mathematical Research Center, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, 202107010021019@ctgu.edu.cn, (M.W.);, zsh@ctgu.edu.cn, (S.Z.);, ring024@126.com, (L.G.); China Three Gorges University); Zheng, Sheng (China Three Gorges University; Three Gorges Mathematical Research Center, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, 202107010021019@ctgu.edu.cn, (M.W.);, zsh@ctgu.edu.cn, (S.Z.);, ring024@126.com, (L.G.); China Three Gorges University); Zeng, Shuguang (China Three Gorges University); Gao, Ling (China Three Gorges University; Three Gorges Mathematical Research Center, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002, China;, 202107010021019@ctgu.edu.cn, (M.W.);, zsh@ctgu.edu.cn, (S.Z.);, ring024@126.com, (L.G.); China Three Gorges University)",11,11,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/13/4662/pdf?version=1657005687,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149197384,34 Chemical Sciences; 40 Engineering,

The fractal dimension (Df) of retinal vessels has been shown to be related to the pathology of a number of ophthalmic disorders, but it hasn’t been investigated in TAO.MethodsWe analyzed 1078 participants aged 18 to 72 (548 healthy volunteers and 530 TAO). Images were captured using a non-mydriatic 45-degree fundus camera. Baseline retinal characteristics, such as vessel width, tortuosity, and Df were measured using semiautomated software from fundus images. The average retinal parameters were compared between the two groups. The receiver operation curve (ROC) was used to assess the diagnostic efficacy of various retinal vascular parameters for TAO.ResultsDespite controlling for potential confounding variables, Df, vessel width, and tortuosity significantly increased in TAO compared to healthy volunteers. Compared to active TAO, patients in the inactive phase had a larger retinal venous caliber (p < 0.05), but there was no difference in Df or arterial caliber. Moderate and severe cases had a higher Df compared with mild cases (EUGOGO guidelines). The area under the ROC for Df, tortuosity, and vascular caliber in the diagnosis of TAO was 0.904 (95% CI: 0.884–0.924), 0.638 (95% CI: 0.598–0.679), and 0.617 (95% CI: 0.576–0.658), respectively.ConclusionsDue to its accessibility, affordability, and non-invasive nature, retinal vascular Df may serve as a surrogate marker for TAO and might be used to identify severe cases. With relatively high diagnostic performance, the Df is of some utility for the detection of TAO.",,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82071005); and the Special Fund of the Pediatric Medical Coordinated Development Center of Beijing Hospitals Authority, China (No. XTCX201824).",Endocrine,,,,2024-02-03,2024,2024-02-03,2024-02-03,,,1-8,,,"Jiang, Xue; Dong, Li; Luo, Lihua; Zhou, Dengji; Ling, Saiguang; Li, Dongmei","Jiang, Xue (Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences Key Lab, Capital Medical University, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Beijing, China); Dong, Li (Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences Key Lab, Capital Medical University, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Beijing, China); Luo, Lihua (Department of Ophthalmology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China); Zhou, Dengji (EVision Technology (Beijing) Co.

It has been suggested that subgroups of patients may benefit from this treatment; however, the effects of adding anti-VEGF treatment to a standard chemotherapy regimen in breast cancer patients are not well studied. Understanding the effects of the anti-vascular treatment on tumor vasculature may provide a selection of patients that can benefit. The aim of this study was to study the vascular effect of bevacizumab using clinical dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). A total of 70 women were randomized to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy with bevacizumab for 25 weeks. DCE-MRI was performed at baseline and at 12 and 25 weeks, and in addition 25 of 70 patients agreed to participate in an early MRI after one week. Voxel-wise pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using semi-quantitative methods and the extended Tofts model. Vascular architecture was assessed by calculating the fractal dimension of the contrast-enhanced images. Changes during treatment were compared with baseline and between the treatment groups. There was no significant difference in tumor volume at any point; however, DCE-MRI parameters revealed differences in vascular function and vessel architecture. Adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy led to a pronounced reduction in vascular DCE-MRI parameters, indicating decreased vascularity. At 12 and 25 weeks, the difference between the treatment groups is severely reduced.",,This project received funding from the University of Oslo: Life Science initiative through the convergence environment grant PerCaThe and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No. 847912.,Cancers,,"Pierre Sonveaux, Mark W Dewhirst, Gregory M.

However, the investigation into the evolutionary mechanisms underlying disintegration breakage has not yet received extensive exploration. In order to comprehensively examine the disintegration characteristics of red-bed soft rock, the slake durability tests were conducted to red-bed soft rocks of varying burial depths. Subsequently, an investigation was carried out to examine the disintegration characteristics and the evolution of disintegration parameters, including the coefficient of uniformity (Cu), coefficient of curvature (Cc), disintegration rate (DRE), disintegration ratio (Dr), and fractal dimension (D), throughout the disintegration process. Finally, employing the energy dissipation theory, an energy dissipation model was developed to predicate the disintegration process of samples at various burial depths. The findings demonstrate a decrease in the abundance of large particles and a concurrent increase in the abundance of small particles as the number of drying-wetting cycles increases. Furthermore, as the number of drying-wetting cycles increases, a significant alteration is observed in the content of particles larger than 10 mm, whereas the content of particles smaller than 10 mm undergoes only minor changes. The disintegration parameters, including the curvature coefficient, non-uniformity coefficient, disintegration rate, and fractal dimension, exhibit a positive correlation with the number of drying-wetting cycles. Conversely, the disintegration index demonstrates a decreasing trend with the increasing number of cycles. Nevertheless, as the burial depth increases, a notable trend emerges in the disintegration process, characterized by a gradual increase in the content of large particles alongside a progressive decrease in the content of small particles. Concurrently, the curvature coefficient, non-uniformity coefficient, disintegration rate, and fractal dimension exhibit a gradual decline, while the durability index experiences a gradual increase. In addition, based on the principle of energy dissipation, it is revealed that the surface energy increment of red-bed soft rock increases with the increase of the number of drying-wetting cycles, but decreases with the increase of burial depth. Ultimately, by leveraging the outcomes of energy dissipation analyses, a theoretical model is constructed to elucidate the correlation between surface energy and both the number of drying-wetting cycles and burial depth. This model serves as a theoretical reference for predicting the disintegration behavior of samples, offering valuable insights for future research endeavors.","This research is financially supported by the Open Research Fund of Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Green Building and Assembly Construction, Anhui Institute of Building Research &amp; Design (Grant NO. 2023-JKYL-005), National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 42302323), University Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Province (2023AH050176).",,Scientific Reports,,,,2024-04-01,2024,2024-04-01,,14,1,7662,,,"Zhang, Jun; Guo, Yang; Huang, Kai; Cui, Wei; Ke, Zhaibang; Chen, Xiaochuang; Yue, Tengsheng; Gao, Kun","Zhang, Jun (Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Green Building and Assembly Construction, Anhui Institute of Building Research & Design, 230601, Hefei, Anhui, China; Anhui Construction Engineering Inspection Technology Group CO, LTD, 230061, Hefei, Anhui, China); Guo, Yang (Anhui Construction Engineering Inspection Technology Group CO, LTD, 230061, Hefei, Anhui, China); Huang, Kai (Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Green Building and Assembly Construction, Anhui Institute of Building Research & Design, 230601, Hefei, Anhui, China; College of Civil Engineering, Anhui Jianzhu University, 230601, Hefei, Anhui, China; Anhui Institute of Intelligent Underground Detection Technology, Anhui Jianzhu University, 230601, Hefei, Anhui, China); Cui, Wei (Anhui Construction Engineering Inspection Technology Group CO, LTD, 230061, Hefei, Anhui, China); Ke, Zhaibang (Anhui Construction Engineering Inspection Technology Group CO, LTD, 230061, Hefei, Anhui, China); Chen, Xiaochuang (Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Green Building and Assembly Construction, Anhui Institute of Building Research & Design, 230601, Hefei, Anhui, China); Yue, Tengsheng (Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Green Building and Assembly Construction, Anhui Institute of Building Research & Design, 230601, Hefei, Anhui, China); Gao, Kun (Anhui Construction Engineering Inspection Technology Group CO, LTD, 230061, Hefei, Anhui, China)","Huang, Kai (Anhui Institute of Architectural Research and Design; Anhui Jianzhu University; Anhui Jianzhu University)","Zhang, Jun (Anhui Institute of Architectural Research and Design; Anhui Construction Engineering Inspection Technology Group CO, LTD, 230061, Hefei, Anhui, China); Guo, Yang (Anhui Construction Engineering Inspection Technology Group CO, LTD, 230061, Hefei, Anhui, China); Huang, Kai (Anhui Institute of Architectural Research and Design; Anhui Jianzhu University; Anhui Jianzhu University); Cui, Wei (Anhui Construction Engineering Inspection Technology Group CO, LTD, 230061, Hefei, Anhui, China); Ke, Zhaibang (Anhui Construction Engineering Inspection Technology Group CO, LTD, 230061, Hefei, Anhui, China); Chen, Xiaochuang (Anhui Institute of Architectural Research and Design); Yue, Tengsheng (Anhui Institute of Architectural Research and Design); Gao, Kun (Anhui Construction Engineering Inspection Technology Group CO, LTD, 230061, Hefei, Anhui, China)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-57901-6.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170310577,40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,7 Affordable and Clean Energy
3314,pub.1156337288,10.1039/d3sm00111c,36988480,,Modelling network formation in folded protein hydrogels by cluster aggregation kinetics,"Globular folded protein-based hydrogels are becoming increasingly attractive due to their specific biological functionality, as well as their responsiveness to stimuli. By modelling folded proteins as colloids, there are rich opportunities to explore network formation mechanisms in protein hydrogels that negate the need for computationally expensive simulations which capture the full complexity of proteins. Here we present a kinetic lattice-based model which simulates the formation of irreversibly chemically crosslinked, folded protein-based hydrogels. We identify the critical point of gel percolation, explore the range of network regimes covering diffusion-limited to reaction-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA and RLCA, respectively) network formation mechanisms and predict the final network structure, fractal dimensions and final gel porosity. We reveal a crossover between DLCA and RLCA mechanisms as a function of protein volume fraction and show how the final network structure is governed by the structure at the percolation point, regardless of the broad variation of non-percolating cluster masses observed across all systems. An analysis of the pore size distribution in the final network structures reveals that, approaching RLCA, gels have larger maximal pores than the DLCA counterparts for both volume fractions studied. This general kinetic model and the analysis tools generate predictions of network structure and concurrent porosity over a broad range of experimentally controllable parameters that are consistent with current expectations and understanding of experimental results.","K.

However, most studies in this area have used relatively small monocentric data and focused on a limited range of EEG features, making it difficult to compare the utility of different sets of EEG features for emotion recognition. This study addressed that by comparing the classification accuracy (performance) of a comprehensive range of EEG feature sets for identifying emotional states, in terms of valence and arousal. The classification accuracy of five EEG feature sets were investigated, including statistical features, fractal dimension (FD), Hjorth parameters, higher order spectra (HOS), and those derived using wavelet analysis. Performance was evaluated using two classifier methods, support vector machine (SVM) and classification and regression tree (CART), across five independent and publicly available datasets linking EEG to emotional states: MAHNOB-HCI, DEAP, SEED, AMIGOS, and DREAMER. The FD-CART feature-classification method attained the best mean classification accuracy for valence (85.06%) and arousal (84.55%) across the five datasets. The stability of these findings across the five different datasets also indicate that FD features derived from EEG data are reliable for emotion recognition. The results may lead to the possible development of an online feature extraction framework, thereby enabling the development of an EEG-based emotion recognition system in real time.",The authors would like to thank the research teams who collected and made the datasets available publicly and for granting access to the datasets.,"This research was financed by the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) through the Education Research Funding Programme (ERFP) (Grant No: PG 03/21 YR), which was overseen by the National Institute of Education (NIE), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.",Sensors,,"Yifan Zhao, Fei He, Yuzhu Guo","Humans; Emotions; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Wavelet Analysis; Recognition, Psychology; Electroencephalography",2023-01-12,2023,2023-01-12,,23,2,915,,,"Yuvaraj, Rajamanickam; Thagavel, Prasanth; Thomas, John; Fogarty, Jack; Ali, Farhan","Yuvaraj, Rajamanickam (National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637616, Singapore); Thagavel, Prasanth (Interdisciplinary Graduate School, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798, Singapore); Thomas, John (Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 2B4, Canada); Fogarty, Jack (National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637616, Singapore); Ali, Farhan (National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 637616, Singapore)","Yuvaraj, Rajamanickam (Nanyang Technological University)","Yuvaraj, Rajamanickam (Nanyang Technological University); Thagavel, Prasanth (Nanyang Technological University); Thomas, John (Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital; McGill University); Fogarty, Jack (Nanyang Technological University); Ali, Farhan (Nanyang Technological University)",15,15,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/2/915/pdf?version=1674197703,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154529899,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Higuchi’s fractal dimension (HFD) have excellent performance in describing sequences’ structural and complexity information for APPA. However, with the exponential growth of protein sequence data, it is very important to develop a reliable APPA method for protein sequence analysis.ResultsConsequently, we propose a new method named FFP, it joints FFT and HFD. Firstly, FFP is used to encode protein sequences on the basis of the important physicochemical properties of amino acids, the dissociation constant, which determines acidity and basicity of protein molecules. Secondly, FFT and HFD are used to generate the feature vectors of encoded sequences, whereafter, the distance matrix is calculated from the cosine function, which describes the degree of similarity between species. The smaller the distance between them, the more similar they are. Finally, the phylogenetic tree is constructed. When FFP is tested for phylogenetic analysis on four groups of protein sequences, the results are obviously better than other comparisons, with the highest accuracy up to more than 97%.ConclusionFFP has higher accuracy in APPA and multi-sequence alignment. It also can measure the protein sequence similarity effectively. And it is hoped to play a role in APPA’s related research.",Not applicable.,"This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under No. 61862005 and No. 61762009.

Our objective was to evaluate its repeatability and reproducibility in healthy eyes. A cross-sectional study was undertaken with young, healthy volunteers who had no reported cardiac risk factors or ocular disease history. For each participant, three SS-OCTA images (12 × 12 mm) were acquired using the Plex Elite 9000 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) by two ophthalmologists. Automated segmentation was obtained from both the superficial and deep capillary plexuses. FD was estimated by box counting. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used as measures for repeatability and reproducibility. A total of 43 eyes of healthy volunteers were included. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age was 30 ± 6.2 years. The results show good repeatability. The ICC was 0.722 (95% CI, 0.541-0.839) in the superficial capillary plexus and 0.828 (95% CI, 0.705-0.903) in the deep capillary plexus. For reproducibility, the ICC was 0.651 (95% CI, 0.439-0.795) and 0.363 (95% CI, 0.073-0.596) at the superficial and deep capillary plexus, respectively.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with line profile and two-dimensional power spectral density (2D-PSD) analysis was utilized to investigate the evolution of surface morphology as a function of fluence. The AFM images were utilized to investigate the relationship between fractal dimension, roughness exponent, lateral correlation length, and ion fluence. The surface erosion owing to sputtering was depicted using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. The structural characteristics' dependency on fluence was explored with the help of glancing angle x-ray diffraction measurements on virgin and irradiated samples. Tensile stress calculated using a peak shift in the glancing angle x-ray diffractogram showed an increase in tensile stress with fluence that caused the surface to crack after the fracture strength of the surface was crossed. 2D-PSD analysis signified the role of sputtering over surface diffusion for the observed surface modifications. Fractal dimensions first increased and then decreased with ion fluence. The lateral correlation length decreased, while the roughness exponent increased with fluence after the threshold value.","The authors greatly acknowledge the support received from the IUAC, New Delhi.

This is important because some authors see one of the causes of this disease in the impaired postural control. Moreover, there is a reciprocal link between the level of postural imbalance and the clinical picture of these people. Therefore, we compared the center-of-pressure (COP) indices of 24 patients with AIS to 48 controls (CON) during four 20-s quiet stance trials with eyes open (EO) or closed (EC) and on firm or foam surface. This included sway amplitude, speed, sample entropy and fractal dimension. AIS had poorer postural steadiness only in the most difficult trial. In the remaining trials, AIS did as well as CON, while presenting a greater COP entropy than CON. Thus, the factor that made both groups perform equally could be the increased sway irregularity in AIS, which is often linked to higher automaticity and lower attention involvement in balance control. After changing the surface from hard to foam, puzzling changes in sway fractality were revealed. The patients decreased the fractal dimension in the sagittal plane identically to the CON in the frontal plane. This may suggest some problems with the perception of body axes in patients and reveals a hitherto unknown cause of their balance deficit.",,,Scientific Reports,,,Adolescent; Entropy; Female; Fractals; Humans; Kyphosis; Postural Balance; Scoliosis,2022-08-01,2022,2022-08-01,,12,1,13170,,,"Piątek-Krzywicka, Elżbieta; Borzucka, Dorota; Kuczyński, Michał","Piątek-Krzywicka, Elżbieta (Faculty of Physiotherapy, University School of Physical Education in Wroclaw, ul.

The research on radon exhalation performance through pore structure is still in its early stages. In this paper, the pore structure and radon exhalation characteristics of heat-treated limestone are studied using indoor tests such as nuclear magnetic and radon measurements. The study's results demonstrate that the radon exhalation rate of limestone initially increases gradually, followed by a steady decline and subsequent increase with the increase in temperature. The radon exhalation rate at 800 °C reaches 2.42 times that at room temperature. The pore structure change within limestone strongly correlates with the radon exhalation rate. The pore volume of micropores (<0.1 μm) plays an essential role in the radon exhalation capacity, which is directly related to the fractal dimension of micropore structure in the heated limestone.

Currently, all of the resulting organizations offer competitive pricing tactics to create a superior environment for our ongoing establishment. Some time ago, it was noted that a merger occurred, although some functions and technology integration remained with the previous structure. In this paper, it has been discovered that merger and acquisition deals have an impact on the firm’s value; in other words, we can view it as shareholders’ wealth or unit depending on the stock price after the announcement of merger and acquisition deals in the short term. Furthermore, we focused on influencing variables on stock prices after the announcement of merger and acquisition transactions, which is measured as a percentage change in the stock prices of the listed resulting firms. Furthermore, this research is based on secondary data sources from reputable organizations. It primarily uses the NSE database and website to evaluate announcements and stock prices of the twenty-nine publicly traded companies. Markets respond to investors’ emotions and market expertise. When acquirers have a strong market position, market capitalization rises in other segments. However, it is declining due to a lack of supportive finances.

The adsorption isotherm, adsorption capacity, pore volume, pore specific surface area, and average pore diameter of coal samples were analyzed by BET and DFT models in order to study the influence of particle size on the pore structure of anthracite and determine the optimal range of particle size for low-temperature nitrogen adsorption test. The results indicate that the particle size plays a significant effect on the pore structure of anthracite and the adsorption capacity of soft coal is less affected by particle size, while hard coal is substantially affected by particle size. The adsorption capacity of hard coal with particle size of > 200 mesh is increased by 7 times when compared with the particle size of 60–80 mesh, indicating that the gas molecular mobility hindrance decline and pore connectivity improves with the decrease of particle size. The average pore diameter of hard coal decreases continuously from 3.1424 to 2.854 nm, while that of soft coal expands from 2.8947 to 3.2515 nm and then to 3.0362 nm with the decrease of particle size. The effects of particle size on the pore surface area of soft and hard coal are concentrated within the < 10 nm pore aperture. Effect of particle size on hard coal pore volume is mainly focused in the pore size < 10 nm, whereas that of soft coal is primarily concentrated in the pore with aperture ranges of 2–100 nm. When the particle sizes varies from 60–80 mesh to 150–200 mesh, the collapse of large pore of hard coal appears better than that of closed pore. When the particle size of hard coal reaches > 200 mesh, the collapse of closed pores and the damage to small pores are stronger than the collapse of large pores. The fractal dimensions with relative pressure of 0–0.20 and 0.20–0.995 are defined as D1 and D2, respectively, and when the fractal dimension D1 increases, the surface roughness and structural complexity of coal samples increase with the decrease of anthracite particle size, while the fractal dimension D2 shows the opposite trend, which indicates that anthracite of smaller particle size possess higher adsorption capacity. Therefore, 150–200 mesh is recommended as the preferred anthracite particle size in low-temperature nitrogen adsorption test.",,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51704100, No. 52074107, No.52074105, No.51874122);

The mineral balangeroite has been identified in an asbestiform habit from the Balangero chrysotile mine (Italy). Previous studies did not contain a detailed description of the fiber dimensions, thus limiting possible approaches to estimating their carcinogenic potential.
OBJECTIVES: To reconstruct excess mesothelioma risk based on characteristics of mixed fiber exposure.
METHODS: The lengths and widths of particles from a sample of balangeroite were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Statistical analysis and modeling were applied to assess the toxicological potential of balangeroite.
RESULTS: Balangeroite fibers are characterized as asbestiform, with geometric mean length of 10 μm, width of 0.54 μm, aspect ratio of 19, and specific surface area of 13.8 (1/μm). Proximity analysis shows dimensional characteristics of balangeroite close to asbestiform anthophyllite. Modeling estimates the average potency of balangeroite as 0.04% (95% CI 0.0058, 0.16) based on dimensional characteristics and 0.05% (95% CI-0.04, 0.24) based on epidemiological data. The available estimate of the fraction of balangeroite in the Balangero mine is very approximate. There were no data for airborne balangeroite fibers from the Balangero mine and no lung burden data are available. All estimates were performed using weight fractions of balangeroite and chrysotile. However, based on reasonable assumptions, of the seven cases of mesothelioma in the cohort, about three cases (43%) can be attributed to fibrous balangeroite.
CONCLUSION: The presence of different types of mineral fibers in aerosolized materials even in small proportions can explain observed cancer risks.","The authors are grateful to Dr. Francesco Turci who provided the balangeroite sample for the study.

Naturalistic stimuli recruit complex and overlapping cognitive, emotional and sensory brain processes. Brain oscillations form underlying mechanisms for such processes, and further, these processes can be modified by expertise. Human cortical functions are often analyzed with linear methods despite brain as a biological system is highly nonlinear. This study applies a relatively robust nonlinear method, Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD), to classify cortical functions of math experts and novices when they solve long and complex math demonstrations in an EEG laboratory. Brain imaging data, which is collected over a long time span during naturalistic stimuli, enables the application of data-driven analyses. Therefore, we also explore the neural signature of math expertise with machine learning algorithms. There is a need for novel methodologies in analyzing naturalistic data because formulation of theories of the brain functions in the real world based on reductionist and simplified study designs is both challenging and questionable. Data-driven intelligent approaches may be helpful in developing and testing new theories on complex brain functions. Our results clarify the different neural signature, analyzed by HFD, of math experts and novices during complex math and suggest machine learning as a promising data-driven approach to understand the brain processes in expertise and mathematical cognition.","We would like to acknowledge the Future Learning Initiative (FLI) at ETH Zurich.

The static structure factor exhibits diverging power-law behavior for small wave numbers, allowing us to identify a structural fractal dimension d_{f}. In three dimensions, d_{f}≈2.0 for 2.5≤β≤3.8, such that each of the structure factors can be collapsed onto a universal curve. In two dimensions, we instead find 1.0≲d_{f}≲1.34 for 2.1≤β≤2.9. Furthermore, we show that the fractal behavior persists when rattler particles are removed, indicating that the long-wavelength structural properties of the packings are controlled by the large particle backbone conferring mechanical rigidity to the system.

However, the connection between retinal circulation and cognitive function lacked consistent and longitudinal evidence. This study aimed to explore the association between retinal vascular complexity and cognitive impairment over time in non-demented community-dwelling older adults.
METHODS: This four-year prospective cohort study (2015-2019) is part of the ongoing Taiwan Initiative for Geriatric Epidemiological Research (TIGER, 2011 to present). Of the 434 older adults (age >65) recruited, 207 participants were included for analysis. The retinal vascular Df was assessed by baseline images from fundus photography (2015-2017). Global (Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Taiwanese version, MoCA-T) and domain-specific cognition were assessed at the baseline and 2-year follow-up (2017-2019). The multivariable linear regression models and generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the association of Df with cognitive decline/impairment over time.
RESULTS: Decreased left retinal vascular complexity was associated with poor attention performance (β = -0.40). As follow-up time increased, decreased vascular complexity was associated with poor memory performance (right: β = -0.25; left: β = -0.19), and decreased right vascular complexity was associated with poor attention performance (β = -0.18).
CONCLUSION: Low retinal vascular complexity of the right or left eye may be differentially associated with cognitive domains in community-dwelling older adults over two years. The retinal vascular Df of either eye may be served as a screening tool for detecting cognitive impairment in the preclinical phase of dementia.",,"This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan (100-2314-B-002-103, 101-2314-B-002-126-MY3, and 104-2314-B-002-038-MY3) and a grant from Academia Sinica (AS-IA-105-M01).

The fractal dimension is utilized to estimate the time series geometrical complexity level, which in this case is applied to the COVID-19 problem. The main aim of utilizing interval type-3 fuzzy logic is for handling uncertainty in the decision-making occurring in forecasting. The hybrid approach is formed by an interval type-3 fuzzy model structured by fuzzy if then rules that utilize as inputs the linear and non-linear values of the dimension, and the forecasts of COVID-19 cases are the outputs. The contribution is the new scheme based on the fractal dimension and interval type-3 fuzzy logic, which has not been proposed before, aimed at achieving an accurate forecasting of complex time series, in particular for the COVID-19 case. Publicly available data sets are utilized to construct the interval type-3 fuzzy system for a time series.

Chromosome conformation capture and imaging experiments have suggested that chromatin adopts a compact structure with limited interpenetration between chromosomes and between chromosomal sections. We developed a theory demonstrating that active loop extrusion causes the apparent fractal dimension of chromatin to cross-over between two and four at contour lengths on the order of 30 kilo-base pairs. The anomalously high fractal dimension [Formula: see text] is due to the inability of extruded loops to fully relax during active extrusion. Compaction on longer contour length scales extends within topologically associated domains (TADs), facilitating gene regulation by distal elements. Extrusion-induced compaction segregates TADs such that overlaps between TADs are reduced to less than 35% and increases the entanglement strand of chromatin by up to a factor of 50 to several Mega-base pairs. Furthermore, active loop extrusion couples cohesin motion to chromatin conformations formed by previously extruding cohesins and causes the mean square displacement of chromatin loci during lag times ([Formula: see text]) longer than tens of minutes to be proportional to [Formula: see text]. We validate our results with hybrid molecular dynamics-Monte Carlo simulations and show that our theory is consistent with experimental data. This work provides a theoretical basis for the compact organization of interphase chromatin, explaining the physical reason for TAD segregation and suppression of chromatin entanglements which contribute to efficient gene regulation.",M.R. acknowledges funding support by the NSF under grant number EFMA-1830957 and the NIH under grant numbers P01-HL164320 and 5P01-HL108808.,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,"Interphase; Chromatin; Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone; Cohesins; Cell Cycle Proteins; Humans; Animals; Chromosome Segregation",2024-05-16,2024,2024-05-16,2024-05-21,121,21,e2401494121,,,"Chan, Brian; Rubinstein, Michael","Chan, Brian (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708); Rubinstein, Michael (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708; Thomas Lord Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708; Department of Physics, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708; Department of Chemistry, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708; World Premier International Research Center Initiative–Institute for Chemical Reaction Design and Discovery, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 001-0021, Japan)","Rubinstein, Michael (Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Hokkaido University)","Chan, Brian (Duke University); Rubinstein, Michael (Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Duke University; Hokkaido University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.22.576729,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171727840,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,

Herein, the influence of ultrasonication on flocculant dosage in dehydration process of unclassified tailings was studied. The effects of flocculant dosage on initial settling rate (ISR), underflow concentration, and effective settling time in the process were investigated in detail. The directivity characteristics of ultrasound transducers with different frequencies in unclassified tailings slurry was simulated by MATLAB. The morphologies of underflow tailings at different flocculant dosages were detected by environmental scanning electron microscope (E-SEM). The relationship between flocculant dosage and fractal dimension (DF) was quantitatively analyzed based on fractal theory. The influence mechanism of flocculant on the settling and thickening of unclassified tailings was revealed. The results show that the optimum flocculant dosage for the ultrasonically treated tailings slurry is 40 g/t, at which the ISR reach a maximum value of 0.262 cm/min and the final underflow concentration (FUC) reach a maximum value in 60 min. Compared with settling without ultrasonication, the optimum flocculant dosage is reduced by 10 g/t, the ISR increases by 10.45%, the effective settling time is reduced by 50 min, and the FUC increases by 1.65%. The fractal dimension of underflow tailings first increases and then decreases with the increase in flocculant dosage, the relationship of which is in accordance with Lorentz model.",,"This study was supported by funds from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 52104138, 51774045).",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Flocculation; Fractals,2023-04-06,2023,2023-04-06,2023-05,30,21,60354-60366,,,"Zhu, Liyi; Yang, Peng; Wang, Kun; Lyu, Wensheng","Zhu, Liyi (School of Civil and Resource Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 100083, Beijing, China; Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Alberta, T6G 2V4, Edmonton, Canada); Yang, Peng (Beijing Key Laboratory of Information Service Engineering, Beijing Union University, 100101, Beijing, China); Wang, Kun (College of Energy and Mining Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, 266590, Qingdao, China); Lyu, Wensheng (School of Civil and Resource Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 100083, Beijing, China)","Lyu, Wensheng (University of Science and Technology Beijing)","Zhu, Liyi (University of Science and Technology Beijing; University of Alberta); Yang, Peng (Beijing Union University); Wang, Kun (Shandong University of Science and Technology); Lyu, Wensheng (University of Science and Technology Beijing)",3,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157070883,34 Chemical Sciences; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

The proposed algorithm consists of the following three steps. First, target infrared features based on a real infrared image are extracted through pretrained VGG-19 networks. Next, by implementing a neural style-transfer algorithm to a simulated infrared image, fractal nature features from the real infrared image are progressively applied to the image. Therefore, the fractal characteristics of the simulated image are improved. Finally, based on the results of fractal analysis, peak signal-to-noise (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and natural image quality evaluator (NIQE) texture evaluations are performed to know how the simulated infrared image is properly transformed as it contains the real infrared fractal features. We verified the proposed methodology using a simulation with three different simulation conditions with a real mid-wave infrared (MWIR) image. As a result, the enhanced simulated infrared images based on the proposed algorithm have better NIQE and SSIM score values in both brightness and fractal characteristics, indicating the closest similarity to the given actual infrared image. The proposed image fractal feature analysis technique can be widely used not only for the simulated infrared images but also for general synthetic images.",,This work was supported by the AI based Flight Control Research Laboratory funded by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration under Grant UD200045CD.,Sensors,,Saed Moradi,"Fractals; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Image Enhancement; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted",2022-12-30,2022,2022-12-30,,23,1,422,,,"Kim, Taeyoung; Bang, Hyochoong","Kim, Taeyoung (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.); Bang, Hyochoong (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea.)","Bang, Hyochoong (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)","Kim, Taeyoung (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology); Bang, Hyochoong (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)",3,3,1.93,2.06,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/1/422/pdf?version=1672893703,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154189037,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation,

The analysis of information surface data is used to determine the impact of relaxation time on the characteristic parameters of creeping discharges. The same information is used to make a comparative study of the morphology of discharges propagating in palm kernel oil methyl ester (PKOME) and in mineral oil (MO). Other comparative methods based on fractal analysis and normality hypothesis tests associated with Anderson Darling (AD), Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) and Shapiro-Wilk (SW) statistics are used. The results show that very short relaxation times increase the error on the measurement of the fractal dimension and the maximum extension of the discharges. A growth of the mutual information between 0 and 60% is observed for relaxation times varying between 60s and 420s respectively. For the same time interval, the P-value increases from 0.027 to 0.821 according to the AD statistic, from 0.01 to more than 0.150 according to KS and from 0.083 to more than 0.1 according to SW. This result indicates that the data are from a normal distribution. After 420s of relaxation, the error on the maximum extension measurement is reduced by 94% in PKOME and 92% in MO. Similarly, the error on the mean fractal dimension in MO is reduced by 86.7% for a relaxation time between 301s and 420s, and by 84.6% in PKOME for a time between 180s and 420s. These different results imply that the impact of the discharge can be predicted when it is in its initial phase during which the number of discharge occurrences is reduced. On the other hand, the physicochemical characteristics of the insulating liquid used dictate the relaxation time to be allowed for the laboratory measurements.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"The authors of this paper did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Heliyon,,,,2023-06-01,2023,2023-06-01,2023-06,9,6,e16796,,,"Jiosseu, Jean Lambert; Mengounou, Ghislain Mengata; Nkouetcha, Emeric Tchamdjio; Imano, Adolphe Moukengue","Jiosseu, Jean Lambert (Pure Physique Laboratory UFD MIP, University of Douala, Douala, Cameroon); Mengounou, Ghislain Mengata (Laboratory of Technology and Applied Sciences, University of Douala, Douala, Cameroon); Nkouetcha, Emeric Tchamdjio (Laboratory of Technology and Applied Sciences, University of Douala, Douala, Cameroon); Imano, Adolphe Moukengue (Pure Physique Laboratory UFD MIP, University of Douala, Douala, Cameroon; Laboratory of Technology and Applied Sciences, University of Douala, Douala, Cameroon)","Jiosseu, Jean Lambert (University of Douala)","Jiosseu, Jean Lambert (University of Douala); Mengounou, Ghislain Mengata (University of Douala); Nkouetcha, Emeric Tchamdjio (University of Douala); Imano, Adolphe Moukengue (University of Douala; University of Douala)",4,4,,,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844023040033/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158537842,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4601 Applied Computing,

Despite the development of new treatment options, the prognosis of high-risk neuroblastoma patients is still poor. Therefore, there is a continuous need to stratify the children suffering from this tumor. A mathematical and computational approach is proposed to enable automatic and precise cancer diagnosis on the histological slide.
METHODS: We targeted the complexity of neuroblastoma by calculating its image entropy (S), fractal dimension (FD), and lacunarity (λ) in a combined mathematical code. First, we tested the proposed method for patient-derived glioma images. It allowed distinguishing between normal brain tissue, grade II, and grade III glioma, which harbor different outcomes.
RESULTS: In neuroblastoma, our analysis of image's FD, S, and λ combined with a machine learning algorithm automatically predicted tumor malignancy with a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82. FD, S, and λ distinguish between neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma, but they only partially differentiate between the normal samples and the other classes. Ganglioneuroma, the most differentiated form, and poorly-differentiated neuroblastoma display different values of FD, S, and λ.
CONCLUSIONS: FD, S, and λ of imaging recognize groups in neuroblastic tumors. We suggest that future studies including these features may challenge the current Shimada classification of neuroblastoma with categories of favorable and unfavorable histology. It is expected that this methodology could trigger multicenter studies and potentially find practical use in the clinical setting of children's hospitals worldwide.",,"Funding This research has been funded by the Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, AB, Canada, Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, ON, Canada, the Stollery Children’s Hospital Foundation, and supporters of the Lois Hole Hospital for Women through the Women and Children’s Health Research Institute, Edmonton, AB, Canada, and the Österreichische Krebshilfe Tyrol (Krebsgesellschaft Tirol, Austrian Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute.

The identification of the dysplasia grade (low-high) is the only consolidated factor used to evaluate this risk. The objective of this study was to verify the role of the fractal dimension (FD) in assessing this dysplasia.
METHODS: To begin, 29 OL and 10 normal oral mucosa (NOM) biopsies were retrieved for FD analysis of the epithelial (dime) and the connective (dimc) tissue.
RESULTS: In the OL group, the median value of dime is higher (1.67, IQR = 0.12) than for the NOM group (1.56, IQR = 0.08), with statistically significant differences (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.0031). There were no differences in relation to dimc. Significant differences were observed between the non-dysplasia vs. high-grade (p = 0.0156) and low-grade vs. high-grade (p = 0.0049) groups. No significant differences were identified in relation to dimc for the different degrees of dysplasia. For a cut-off point of 1.44 of dime, a specificity of 96.6% was obtained, a sensitivity of 100%, and an AUC = 0.819 (p = 0.003).

This paper presents a pilot study for a new evaluative methodology of the fractal dimension in the psychological interview: the analysis of 4 psychological interviews led to the determination of their fractal dimension, defined by the amount of verbal content produced. The conversational turn-taking naturally established in the patient-psychologist dyad divides the verbatim transcripts of the sessions into Relational Verbal Units (RVU), whose sizes are determined by the number of words which composes them. It was observed that the distribution of the RVUs in a size/frequency graph follows a power law distribution, from which it was possible to assess the Relational Fractal Dimension (RFD) of the interviews. The values obtained range from a minimum of 1.39 to a maximum of 1.50, an indicative range of self-organized criticality. Recursion is the simple process behind complexity, and it defines fractal patterns; the fractal dimension of a system characterizes its level of complexity, and its application in psychotherapy describes the therapeutic relationship as a nonlinear dynamic system endowed with self-organization and self-similarity.",,,"Nonlinear Dynamics, Psychology, and Life Sciences",,,"Fractals; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Pilot Projects; Psychotherapy",2022-01,2022,,2022-01,26,1,81-104,,,"Biraschi, Jacopo","Biraschi, Jacopo (Private Practice, Rho, Italy.)",,"Biraschi, Jacopo (Private Practice, Rho, Italy.)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144344730,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,

Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is an emerging newer non-invasive imaging technique and is recently being included in the investigation and treatment of mCNV. However, there exists no standard tool for time-efficient and dependable analysis of OCTA images of mCNV. In this study, we propose a customizable ImageJ macro that automates the OCTA image processing and lets users measure nine mCNV biomarkers. We developed a three-stage image processing pipeline to process the OCTA images using the macro. The images were first manually delineated, and then denoised using a Gaussian Filter. This was followed by the application of the Frangi filter and Local Adaptive thresholding. Finally, skeletonized images were obtained using the Mexican Hat filter. Nine vascular biomarkers including Junction Density, Vessel Diameter, and Fractal Dimension were then computed from the skeletonized images. The macro was tested on a 26 OCTA image dataset for all biomarkers. Two trends emerged in the computed biomarker values. First, the lesion-size dependent parameters (mCNV Area (mm2) Mean = 0.65, SD = 0.46) showed high variation, whereas normalized parameters (Junction Density(n/mm): Mean = 10.24, SD = 0.63) were uniform throughout the dataset. The computed values were consistent with manual measurements within existing literature.

Methods: In this study, we collected the clinical data of 410 patients with T2DM in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between October 2020 and March 2022. Firstly, the patients were randomly divided into a development cohort and a validation cohort in a ratio of 7:3. Then, the modeling factors were selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Subsequently, a nomogram prediction model was built with these identified risk factors. Two other models were constructed with only retinal vascular traits or only clinical traits to confirm the performance advantage of this nomogram model. Finally, the model performances were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
Results: Five predictive variables for DR among patients with T2DM were selected by LASSO regression from 33 variables, including fractal dimension, arterial tortuosity, venular caliber, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), and insulin dosage (P< 0.05). A predictive nomogram model based on these selected clinical and retinal vascular factors presented good discrimination with an AUC of 0.909 in the training cohort and 0.876 in the validation cohort. By comparing the models, the retinal vascular parameters were proven to have a predictive value and could improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when combined with clinical characteristics. The calibration curve displayed high consistency between predicted and actual probability in both training and validation cohorts. The DCA demonstrated that this nomogram model led to net benefits in a wide range of threshold probability and could be adapted for clinical decision-making.

Accurately diagnosing patients with a vegetative state (VS) and patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS), however, might be very complicated, reaching a misdiagnosis of approximately 40% if clinical scales are not carefully administered and continuously repeated. To improve diagnostic accuracy for those patients, tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) might be used in the clinical setting. Many linear indices have been developed to improve the diagnosis in DOC patients, such as spectral power in different EEG frequency bands, spectral power ratios between these bands, and the difference between eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions (i.e. alpha-blocking). On the other hand, much less has been explored using nonlinear approaches. Therefore, in this work, we aim to discriminate between MCS and VS groups using a nonlinear method called Higuchi's Fractal Dimension (HFD) and show that HFD is more sensitive than linear methods based on spectral power methods. For the sake of completeness, HFD has also been tested against another nonlinear approach widely used in EEG research, the Entropy (E). To our knowledge, this is the first time that HFD has been used in EEG data at rest to discriminate between MCS and VS patients. A comparison of Bayes factors found that differences between MCS and VS were 11 times more likely to be detected using HFD than the best performing linear method tested and almost 32 times with respect to the E. Machine learning has also been tested for HFD, reaching an accuracy of 88.6% in discriminating among VS, MCS and healthy controls. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that HFD was more robust to outliers than spectral power methods, showing a clear positive correlation between the HFD and Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) values. In conclusion, our work suggests that HFD could be used as a sensitive marker to discriminate between MCS and VS patients and help decrease misdiagnosis in clinical practice when combined with commonly used clinical scales.",,,International Journal of Neural Systems,,,Bayes Theorem; Consciousness; Electroencephalography; Fractals; Humans; Persistent Vegetative State,2022-07-07,2022,2022-07-07,2022-07,32,07,2250031,,,"Porcaro, Camillo; Marino, Marco; Carozzo, Simone; Russo, Miriam; Ursino, Maria; Ruggiero, Valentina; Ragno, Carmela; Proto, Stefania; Tonin, Paolo","Porcaro, Camillo (Department of Neuroscience and Padova Neuroscience Center (PNC), University of Padova, Padova 35128, Italy.; Institute of Cognitive Sciences, and Technologies (ISTC) - National Research Council (CNR), 00185 Rome, Italy.; Centre for Human Brain Health, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.); Marino, Marco (Movement Control and Neuroplasticity Research Group, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; IRCCS San Camillo, Hospital, Venice, Italy.); Carozzo, Simone (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Russo, Miriam (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Ursino, Maria (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Ruggiero, Valentina (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Ragno, Carmela (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Proto, Stefania (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Tonin, Paolo (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.)","Porcaro, Camillo (University of Padua; Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies; University of Birmingham)","Porcaro, Camillo (University of Padua; Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies; University of Birmingham); Marino, Marco (KU Leuven; Ospedale San Camillo); Carozzo, Simone (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Russo, Miriam (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Ursino, Maria (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Ruggiero, Valentina (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Ragno, Carmela (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Proto, Stefania (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.); Tonin, Paolo (S.Anna Institute - Research in Advanced, Neurorehabilitation, 88900 Crotone, Italy.)",14,14,2.43,,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0129065722500319,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147404053,46 Information and Computing Sciences,

This paper presents a universal water structure analysis of several gels with different structures and gelation mechanisms including polymer gels, supramolecular gels composed of surfactant micelles, and cement gels. The spatial distribution of water molecules was analyzed at molecular level from a diagram of the relaxation times and their distribution parameters (τ-β diagrams) with our database of the 10 GHz process for a variety of aqueous systems. Polymer gels with volume phase transition showed a small decrease in the fractal dimension of the hydrogen bond network (HBN) with gelation. In supramolecular gels with rod micelle precursor with amphipathic molecules, both the elongation of the micelles and their cross-linking caused a reduction in the fractal dimension. Such a reduction was also found in cement gels. These results suggest that the HBN inevitably breaks at each length scale with relative increase in steric hindrance due to cross-linking, resulting in the fragmentation of collective structures of water molecules. The universal analysis using τ-β diagrams presented here has broad applicability as a method to characterize diverse gel structures and evaluate gelation processes.","The authors would like to thank N.

For this, a prospective study was conducted on 18 healthy individuals (mean age 23 ± 2.4 years old) who underwent third molar extraction. Pre-operative CBCT scans were conducted, bone fragments were removed from the retro-molar region, and DPR and µCT were performed on those bone samples. FD.b and FD.f values were calculated using three parasagittal sections for CBCT, one image for DPR, and three sections for µCT. The 3D bone microarchitecture was analyzed in µCT (voxel size: 19 µm). As a result, FD.b mean values of 1.55 ± 0.02 and 1.80 ± 0.01 were obtained for CBCT and µCT, respectively. Furthermore, FD.f mean values of 1.22 ± 0.12 for DPR, 0.99 ± 0.04 for CBCT, and 1.30 ± 0.07 for µCT were obtained. Both FD.b and FD.f values showed a good agreement. FD.f was negatively correlated with the standard deviation of the mean gray value (p = 0.003) for DPR and intra-cortical bone surface (p = 0.02) for µCT. In conclusion, image processing with or without binarization revealed different values for FD, although showing agreement. The grayscale-based method retrieved FD values correlated with the gray levels and the cortical porous network, which means that FD can be a valuable index for mandibular cortical bone evaluation. FD is associated with mineralization and microarchitecture. Nevertheless, there was no correlation between FD values obtained from low- (DPR) and high-resolution (µCT) X-ray modalities with FD obtained from the in vivo CBCT.",The authors thank Dr. Björn Busse and Simon von Kroge for their scientific support.

Absence of sufficient information to read the surrounding causes psychological anxiousness leading to perceived danger or discomfort for the urbanites. Consequently, perceived safety and comfort of the users is distinctively low in urban contexts, creating neglected and underused spaces. Complexity is one of the information processing variables as per Kaplan and Kaplan's informational model which helps users to comprehend the surrounding environment. The streetscape plays a vital role in the daily movement patterns within the urban cities and is the transition boundary between the public and private realms. Visual complexity of these streets is a result of different configurations of elements within the urban areas. This research is conducted to ascertain the relationship between visual complexity levels of the streets with the perceived safety and comfort of the users. Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) and Fractal dimension analysis were conducted with 48 SVIs (Street View Images) selected within 1km radius of Colpetty junction, Colombo Sri Lanka covering all the possible compositions found within the context. The visual index data extraction had identified ten major components within the selected 48 SVIs. 78 subjective ranking responses for perceived safety, comfort (preference) and perceived complexity were collected from snowball sampling. Findings of the study revealed that perceived safety levels and preference scores for the SVIs are related to the Shannon Diversity Index calculation in an inverted 'U' shape where the highest and lowest SDI values are related with low preference scores and low safety levels. The SVIs with medium SDI values are perceived as the safest and most preferred by the users of urban streets of Colombo Sri Lanka. The SDI and fractal dimension values were significantly correlated with the perceived complexity scores of the users. The results of this study can be accommodated in the planning and designing of urban streetscapes of tropical climates for sustainable and friendly urban expansions.",,"This work is a part of a research under AHEAD (Accelerating Higher Education Expansion and Development) project granted to Centre for Cities, Department of Architecture, University of Moratuwa funded by World Bank (Credit/Grant #:6026-LK/8743-LK - DOR 54).

The objective of this study is to evaluate the cortical and trabecular mandibular bone morphology of children and adolescents who have beta-thalassemia major (ß-TM) using a fractal dimension (FD) analysis and different panoramic radiomorphometric indices with digital panoramic radiographic images (DPRIs).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 80 patients (with 40 patients each of ß-TM and control). The mandibular cortical width (MCW), panoramic mandibular index (PMI), mandibular cortical index (MCI), and simple visual estimation (SVE) were evaluated, and an FD analysis of five regions of interest (ROIs) (ROI 1: in basal cortical bone; ROI 2: in premolar region; ROI 3: in molar region; ROI 4: in angulus mandible and ROI 5: in condyle region) was obtained in all DPRIs. Quantitative variables were analyzed using the student's t-test , Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests.
RESULTS: When the ß-TM groups were compared with controls, there were no statistically significant differences found in the mean FD values, the ROIs of the trabecular bone, or the SVE. There was a significant correlation in the mean MCW, PMI, ROI of cortical bone (ROI 1), and MCI between ß-TM and control groups (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.047, and p = 0.046, respectively). The mean MCW values correlated with the SVE in both the ß-TM and control groups (p = 0.031 and p < 0.001, respectively). While the mean MCW values correlated with the MCI (p = 0.04) in the control group, the mean MCW values were not correlated with the MCI (p = 0.493) in ß-TM group.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study revealed lower MCW and PMI values in the ß-TM group. While the mean FD values of trabecular bone is similar to the control groups, the mean FD value is lower in cortical bone in the ß-TM group. MCW, PMI, FD of cortical bone and MCI may be key indicators in individuals with beta-thalassemia major.","Authors contributions B.Y: Concept, Design, Definition of content, Literature search, Data acquisition, Data analysis, Manuscript preparation, Manuscript editing, Manuscript review.

To clarify the geomechanical characteristics of Bimrock, this paper summarizes the basic concepts and classification methods of Bimrock at home and abroad. It discusses the methods and characteristics of determining the geometric features of Bimrock blocks and explores the influencing factors and laws of failure modes and strength under different stress states of Bimrock. The study finds that the failure mode of Bimrock is mainly influenced by factors such as block proportion, degree of welding between blocks and matrix, strength ratio between blocks and matrix, and geometric properties of blocks. Among these factors, block proportion is the most significant, and the degree of welding is a controlling factor. However, due to the complexity of Bimrock structures, there is a lack of applicable methods and mechanical models for the evaluation of geomechanical characteristics of Bimrock in engineering practice.

Moreover, despite the fact microstructure have been extensively studied, the material correlate of Fractal Dimension (FD) as a descriptor of bone microstructure was not clear in previous studies.
METHODS: This study examined the effect of mineral content and density on the mechanical properties of a large number of human rib cortical bone samples. The mechanical properties were calculated using Digital Image Correlation and uniaxial tensile tests. CT scans were used to calculate the Fractal Dimension (FD) of each specimen. For each specimen, the mineral (fmin), organic (forg) and water (fwat) weight fractions were determined. In addition, density was measured after a drying-and-ashing process. Then, Regression Analysis was employed to investigate the relationship between anthropometric variables, weight fractions, density and FD, as well as its impact on the mechanical properties.
FINDINGS: Young's modulus exhibited a power-law relationship with an exponent of α>2.3 when using the conventional density (wet density), but α=2 when using dry density (desecated specimens). In addition, FD increases with decreasing cortical bone density. A significant relationship has been found between FD and density, whereby FD is correlated with the embedding of low density regions in cortical bone.
INTERPRETATION: This study provides a new insight in the exponent value of the power-law relation between Young's Modulus and density, and relates bone behavior with the fragile fracture theory in ceramic materials. Moreover, the results suggest that Fractal Dimension is related to presence of low-density regions.",Declaration of Competing Interest None declared.,None.,Medical Engineering & Physics,,,Humans; Fractals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone Density; Cortical Bone; Ribs,2023-06-05,2023,2023-06-05,2023-07,117,,104004,,,"García-Vilana, S; Sánchez-Molina, D; Velázquez-Ameijide, J; Llumà, J; Arregui-Dalmases, C","García-Vilana, S (UPC-EEBE, Eduard Maristany, 14, 08019 Barcelona, Spain.

A recently formulated but already available criterion is used to determine the shear strength of flocculated kaolin aggregates. The flocculant is a high molecular weight anionic polyelectrolyte. The resistance of the aggregates is evaluated as a function of flocculation time, flocculant dosage, and water quality. The determination is based on a standardized experimental method. First, the time evolution of the average size of kaolin flocs is measured when aggregates are exposed to incremental shear rates from a predetermined base value. Then, the results are fitted to a pseudo-first-order model that allows deriving a characteristic value of the shear rate of rupture associated with the upper limit of the strength of the aggregates. In seawater, at a given dose of flocculant, the strength of the aggregates increases with time up to a maximum; however, at longer times, the resistance decreases until it settles at a stable value corresponding to stable aggregates in size and structure. A higher flocculant dosage leads to stronger aggregates due to more bridges between particles and polymers, leading to a more intricate and resistant particle network. In industrial water with very low salt content, the resistance of the kaolin aggregates is higher than in seawater for the same dose of flocculant. The salt weakens the resistance of the aggregates and works against the efficiency of the flocculant. The study should be of practical interest to concentration plants that use seawater in their operations.","K.P., O.A., R.I.J. and P.G.T. are grateful for the financial support from the CRHIAM Project ANID/FONDAP/15130015.

Computed tomography (CT) is a frontline tool for this task; however, the preservation of predictive radiomic features is highly dependent on the scanning protocol and reconstruction algorithm. We hypothesized that image reconstruction with a high-frequency kernel could result in a better characterization of liver metastases features via deep neural networks. This kernel produces images that appear noisier but preserve more sinogram information. A simulation pipeline was developed to study the effects of imaging parameters on the ability to characterize the features of liver metastases. This pipeline utilizes a fractal approach to generate a diverse population of shapes representing virtual metastases, and then it superimposes them on a realistic CT liver region to perform a virtual CT scan using CatSim. Datasets of 10,000 liver metastases were generated, scanned, and reconstructed using either standard or high-frequency kernels. These data were used to train and validate deep neural networks to recover crafted metastases characteristics, such as internal heterogeneity, edge sharpness, and edge fractal dimension. In the absence of noise, models scored, on average, 12.2% (α=0.012$$\alpha =0.012$$) and 7.5% (α=0.049)$$\alpha =0.049)$$ lower squared error for characterizing edge sharpness and fractal dimension, respectively, when using high-frequency reconstructions compared to standard. However, the differences in performance were statistically insignificant when a typical level of CT noise was simulated in the clinical scan.

The electric flux test method was used to study the chloride ion diffusion resistance of CSRPC after freeze-thaw cycles, and the pore size distribution was obtained through the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method. Then, a mathematical relationship between the chloride ion diffusion coefficient and the pore fractal characteristic parameter T was established to study the effect of freeze-thaw cycles on chloride ion diffusion. Finally, SEM/EDS, XRD, and DTG methods were combined to study the influence of the distribution of Friedel's salts generated after freeze-thaw cycles on chloride ion diffusion in CSRPC. The results indicate that CS has a micro aggregate effect and pozzolanic activity, which can effectively improve the chloride ion diffusion resistance of CSRPC after freeze-thaw cycles. In addition, the electric flux of CSRPC decreases with the increase in freeze-thaw cycles, and the chloride diffusion coefficient is closely related to the pore fractal dimension.",,This research was supported by the Liaoning Provincial Department of Education Foundation Project “Pioneering Research on Key Technology of Copper Slag-Based Assembled Road Base Block Connection” (Project No. LJKMZ20220703).,Materials,,Sukhoon Pyo,,2023-12-30,2023,2023-12-30,,17,1,212,,,"Li, Jun; Liu, Xianzhang; Chen, Minghao; Tian, Lijun; Liu, Jiao","Li, Jun (School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, lj0801@126.com, (J.L.);; Liaoning Key Laboratory of Mine Subsidence Disaster Prevention and Control, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China); Liu, Xianzhang (School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, lj0801@126.com, (J.L.);); Chen, Minghao (School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, lj0801@126.com, (J.L.);); Tian, Lijun (School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, lj0801@126.com, (J.L.);); Liu, Jiao (School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, lj0801@126.com, (J.L.);)","Liu, Xianzhang (Liaoning Technical University; School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, lj0801@126.com, (J.L.);)","Li, Jun (Liaoning Technical University; School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, lj0801@126.com, (J.L.);; Liaoning Technical University); Liu, Xianzhang (Liaoning Technical University; School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, lj0801@126.com, (J.L.);); Chen, Minghao (Liaoning Technical University; School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, lj0801@126.com, (J.L.);); Tian, Lijun (Liaoning Technical University; School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, lj0801@126.com, (J.L.);); Liu, Jiao (Liaoning Technical University; School of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, lj0801@126.com, (J.L.);)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/1/212/pdf?version=1704019509,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167560795,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

A novel macroscopic dendritic copper nanonoodles with the length of 3-50 mm prepared by solid-state ionics method at 10 μA direct current electric field (DCEF) using fast ionic conductor RbCu4Cl3I2 films was reported. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance of prepared copper nanonoodles was detected by crystal violet (CV) and rhodamine B (RB) aqueous solution as analyte molecules. The results present that the copper nanonoodles assembled by short-range order copper nanowires and the diameters of nanowires changed from 20 nm to 80 nm, many regularly arranged nanoparticles with the diameter from 5 to 10 nm existed on the prepared copper nanonoodles, which lead to the nanonoodles have high surface roughness. The copper nanonoodles contain only Cu element, no O element and the fractal dimension of copper nanonoodles is 1.355 because of macroscopic dendritic structures. The prepared copper nanonoodles composed of pure Cu have high surface roughness and the free electrons on the rough copper nanonoodles resonate with the atomic nuclei inside the copper nanonoodles to form a locally enhanced electromagnetic field under the excitation of incident light, so the limiting concentrations for CV and RB detected by the prepared copper nanonoodles are as low as 1 × 10-11 mol/L and 1 × 10-12 mol/L, respectively.

The impact and failure effect of a water shock wave and the mechanism of crack initiation, propagation, and arrest were studied by numerical simulation and the fracturing test of coal, combined with CT scanning, PCAS software, and Mimics 3D reconstruction technology. The results show that a high voltage electric pulse that increases permeability is an effective artificial crack making technology. The crack spreads radially along the borehole, and the damage degree, number, and complexity were positively correlated with the discharge voltage and discharge times. The crack area, volume, damage factor, and other parameters increased steadily. The cracks in the coal first start from two symmetrical angles, and finally distribute in a 360 deg circumferential direction, forming a multiangle crack spatial network structure. The fractal dimension of the crack group increases, the number of microcracks and the roughness of the crack group increases, the overall fractal dimension of the specimen decreases, and the roughness between cracks weakens. The cracks then form a smooth coal-bed methane migration channel. The research results can provide some theoretical guidance for the evaluation of crack damage propagation and the effect of electric pulse fracturing in water.","The study was supported by Inner Mongolia Natural Science Foundation (grant no. 2020LH05018, grant no. 2019MS05053, grant no. 2020BS05017), Inner Mongolia University of Science and Technology Institute of Building Science Open Foundation (grant no.

The pore structure of rock changes significantly during the heat treatment process, which affects the internal emission rate of radon. This study introduces the results of radon emission rate of rock after high temperature and analyzes the effect of the pore structure in rock mass on radon emission. The results show that there is a good positive correlation between temperature and radon emission in rock mass within a certain temperature range, and the higher the temperature, the higher the radon concentration emission. Two igneous rocks have the rate which is highest after the treatment in 400 °C. The absorption and sealing of radon in the microcapillary are the main occurrences of radon in rock mass. This is reflected in the increase in microcapillary porosity and the decrease in DP, which changes the microstructure of the rock and increases the connectivity of the internal pore channels of the rock, thereby increasing the volume and length of the migration channels for radon. These results are helpful to understand the influencing mechanism of radon emission process in rocks.",,This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41972288).,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Hot Temperature; Porosity; Radon; Silicon Dioxide,2022-01-22,2022,2022-01-22,2022-05,29,24,36801-36813,,,"Li, Pengfei; Sun, Qiang; Hu, Jianjun; Jia, Hailiang; Xue, Lei","Li, Pengfei (College of Geology and Environment, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, 710054, Xi’an, Shaanxi, China); Sun, Qiang (College of Geology and Environment, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, 710054, Xi’an, Shaanxi, China; Shaanxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Geological Support for Coal Green Exploitation, 710054, Xi’an, China; Key Laboratory of Coal Resources Exploration and Comprehensive Utilization, Ministry of Land and Resources, Xi’an, China); Hu, Jianjun (College of Water Resource and Hydropower, Sichuan University, 610065, Chengdu, Sichuan, China); Jia, Hailiang (College of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Xi’an University of Science and Technology, 710054, Xi’an, Shaanxi, China); Xue, Lei (Innovation Academy for Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100029, Beijing, China)","Li, Pengfei (Xi'an University of Science and Technology)","Li, Pengfei (Xi'an University of Science and Technology); Sun, Qiang (Xi'an University of Science and Technology; Shaanxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Geological Support for Coal Green Exploitation, 710054, Xi’an, China; Key Laboratory of Coal Resources Exploration and Comprehensive Utilization, Ministry of Land and Resources, Xi’an, China); Hu, Jianjun (Sichuan University); Jia, Hailiang (Xi'an University of Science and Technology); Xue, Lei (Chinese Academy of Sciences)",13,13,1.68,7.01,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144861999,37 Earth Sciences; 3705 Geology; 40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

The wealth of data provided by Hi-C libraries offers the opportunity to unravel this relationship. However, there is a need for a comprehensive theoretical framework in order to extract topological information for genome characterization and comparison. Here, we develop a toolbox for topological analysis based on Circuit Topology, allowing for the quantification of inter- and intracellular genomic heterogeneity, at various levels of fold complexity: pairwise contact arrangement, higher-order contact arrangement, and topological fractal dimension. Single-cell Hi-C data were analyzed and characterized based on topological content, revealing not only a strong multiscale heterogeneity but also highly conserved features such as a characteristic topological length scale and topological signature motifs in the genome. We propose that these motifs inform on the topological state of the nucleus and indicate the presence of active loop extrusion.","The authors acknowledge Duane Moes for help with revising the code and Vahid Satarifard for his help at the early stages of the project.

While the macroscopic properties of such materials strongly depend on the shape and size of these particle aggregates, the morphology and underlining aggregation physical mechanisms are far from being fully understood. Recently, it has been proposed that for reversible colloidal aggregation, the cluster morphology in the case of colloids interacting with short-range attractive forces is determined by a single variable, namely, the reduced second virial coefficient, B2∗.
EXPERIMENTS: We examined this proposal by performing confocal microscopy experiments and computer simulations on a large collection of short-ranged attractive colloidal systems with different values of the attraction strength and range.
FINDINGS: We show that in all cases a connection between the colloidal cluster morphology and B2∗ can be established both in experiments and simulations. This physical scenario holds at all investigated thermodynamic conditions, namely, in the fluid state, in the metastable region and in non-equilibrium conditions. Our findings support the connection between reversible colloidal aggregation and the so-called extended law of corresponding states.","We acknowledge financial support from the project “A1-S-9098” funded by Conacyt within the call “Convocatoria de Investigación Básica 2017-2018” and from “Consorzio per lo Sviluppo dei Sistemi a Grande Interfase” (CSGI).

From visual inspection, we perceive that healthy and COVID-19 chest radiographic images present different levels of geometric complexity. Therefore, we apply fractal dimension and quadtree as feature extractors to characterize such differences. Moreover, real-world datasets often present complex patterns, which are hardly handled by only the physical features of the data (such as similarity, distance, or distribution). This issue is addressed by complex networks, which are suitable tools for characterizing data patterns and capturing spatial, topological, and functional relationships in data. Specifically, we propose a new approach combining complexity measures and complex networks to provide a modified high-level classification technique to be applied to COVID-19 chest radiographic image classification. The computational results on the Kaggle COVID-19 Radiography Database show that the proposed method can obtain high classification accuracy on X-ray images, being competitive with state-of-the-art classification techniques. Lastly, a set of network measures is evaluated according to their potential in distinguishing the network classes, which resulted in the choice of communicability measure. We expect that the present work will make significant contributions to machine learning at the semantic level and to combat COVID-19.","This work is carried out at the Center for Artificial Intelligence (C4AI-USP), with support from the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and the IBM Corporation under FAPESP grant number 2019/07665-4.

Due to the accuracy and the possibility of rapid production, the CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) technology has become the most desired approach in the preparation of elements, especially in medicine and dentistry. This study aimed to compare the biomechanical properties, fractal dimension (FD), and texture of three selected materials used for 3D printing in dentistry. Three biomaterials used in 3D printing were evaluated. The materials were subjected to the compression test. Then, their mechanical features, FD, and texture were analyzed. All the tested materials showed different values for the studied properties. The only statistically insignificant difference was observed for the force used in the compression test. All three materials showed differences in width and height measurements. The difference in the decrease between the compression plates was also significant. For Dental LT Clear, the mean value was 0.098 mm (SD = 0.010), while for BioMed Amber it was 0.059 mm (SD = 0.019), and for IBT it was 0.356 mm (SD = 0.015). The nominal strain also differed between the materials. IBT had the highest mean value (7.98), while BioMed Amber had the smallest (1.31). FD analysis revealed that Dental LT Clear did not show differences in the structure of the material. The other two materials showed significant changes after the compression test. Texture analysis (TA) revealed similar results: BioMed Amber resin showed significantly less pronounced texture changes compared to the other two materials. BioMed Amber also showed the most stable mechanical properties, whereas those of IBT changed the most. Fractal analysis revealed that IBT showed significant differences from the other two materials, whereas TA showed that only Dental LT Clear did not show changes in its texture after the compression test. Before the compression, however, BioMed Amber differed the most when bone index was taken into account.",,"This research was funded by Wrocław Medical University, grant number SUBK.B032.22.023.",Polymers,,"Haw-Ming Huang, Chin-San Wu",,2023-04-02,2023,2023-04-02,,15,7,1772,,,"Paradowska-Stolarz, Anna; Wieckiewicz, Mieszko; Kozakiewicz, Marcin; Jurczyszyn, Kamil","Paradowska-Stolarz, Anna (Division of Dentofacial Anomalies, Department of Maxillofacial Orthopedics and Orthodontics, Wroclaw Medical University, Krakowska 26, 50-425 Wroclaw, Poland); Wieckiewicz, Mieszko (Department of Experimental Dentistry, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-425 Wroclaw, Poland); Kozakiewicz, Marcin (Department of Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical University of Lodz, 90-647 Lodz, Poland); Jurczyszyn, Kamil (Department of Dental Surgery, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-425 Wroclaw, Poland)","Paradowska-Stolarz, Anna (Wroclaw Medical University)","Paradowska-Stolarz, Anna (Wroclaw Medical University); Wieckiewicz, Mieszko (Wroclaw Medical University); Kozakiewicz, Marcin (Medical University of Lodz); Jurczyszyn, Kamil (Wroclaw Medical University)",16,16,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/7/1772/pdf?version=1681286038,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157003978,40 Engineering,

We thoroughly study the interplay between the orientational anisotropy parameter p_{0} of deposited dimers and the formation of porous structures, as well as its impact on the conductivity of the system, through extensive numerical simulations. By systematically varying the value of p_{0}, several critical and off-critical scaling relations characterizing the behavior of the system are examined. The results demonstrate that the degree of orientational anisotropy of dimers plays a significant role in determining the structural and physical characteristics of the system. We find that the Einstein relation relating to the size scaling of the electrical conductance holds true only in the limiting case of p_{0}→1. Monitoring the fractal dimension of the interface of the multilayer formation for various p_{0} values, we reveal that in a wide range of p_{0}>0.2 interface shows the characteristic of a self-avoiding random walk, compared to the limiting case of p_{0}→0 where it is characterized by the fractal dimension of the backbone of ordinary percolation cluster at criticality. Our results thus can provide useful information about the fundamental mechanisms underlying the formation and behavior of wide varieties of amorphous and disordered systems that are of paramount importance both in science and technology as well as in environmental studies.","G.P. thanks a fellowship from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) Process: 381191/2022-2.

To identify a normal pattern of mandibular trabecular bone in children based on the fractal dimension (FD), and its possible correlation with pixel intensity (PI) values, to facilitate the early diagnosis of possible diseases and/or future bone alterations.Materials and methods
The 50 panoramic images were selected and divided into two groups, according to the children’s age: 8–9 (Group 1; n = 25) and 6–7 (Group 2; n = 25). For FD and PI analyses, three regions of interest (ROIs) were selected, and their mean values were evaluated for each ROI, according to each group, using the t test for independent samples and the model of generalized estimation equations (GEE). Subsequently, these mean values were correlated by the Pearson test.ResultsComparing the groups, FD and PI did not differ from each other for any of the measured regions (p > 0.00). It was observed that in the mandible branch (ROI1), FD and PI means were 1.26 ± 0.01 and 81.0 ± 2.50, respectively. In the mandible angle (ROI2), the means were 1.21 ± 0.02 (FD) and 72.8 ± 2.13 (PI); and in the mandible, cortical (ROI3) values of FD = 1.03 ± 0.01 and PI = 91.3 ± 1.75 were obtained. There was no correlation between FD and PI in any of the analyzed ROI (r < 0.285). The FD means of ROI1 and ROI2 did not differ from each other (p = 0.053), but both were different from ROI3 (p < 0.00). All PI values differed from each other (p < 0.00).ConclusionThe bone trabeculate pattern in 6–9-year-old children presented FD between 1.01 and 1.29.

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of LV myocardial trabecular complexity using fractal analysis in patients with DCM.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with DCM who underwent CMR between March 2017 and November 2021 at two hospitals were prospectively enrolled. The primary endpoints were defined as the combination of all-cause death and heart failure hospitalization. The events of cardiac death alone were defined as the secondary endpoints.LV trabeculae complexity was quantified by measuring the fractal dimension (FD) of the endocardial border based on fractal geometry on CMR. Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to examine the association between variables and outcomes. The incremental prognostic value of FD was assessed in nested models.
RESULTS: A total of 403 patients with DCM (49.31 ± 14.68 years, 69% male) were recruited. After a median follow-up of 43 months (interquartile range, 28-55 months), 87 and 24 patients reached the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. Age, heart rate, New York Heart Association functional class >II, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, LV ejection fraction, LV end-diastolic volume index, LV end-systolic volume index, LV mass index, presence of late gadolinium enhancement, global FD, LV mean apical FD, and LV maximal apical FD were univariably associated with the outcomes (all P < 0.05). After multivariate adjustment, LV maximal apical FD remained a significant independent predictor of outcome [hazard ratio = 1.179 (1.116, 1.246), P < 0.001]. The addition of LV maximal apical FD in the nested models added incremental prognostic value to other common clinical and imaging risk factors (all <0.001; C-statistic: 0.84-0.88, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: LV maximal apical FD was an independent predictor of the adverse clinical outcomes in patients with DCM and provided incremental prognostic value over conventional clinical and imaging risk factors.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this work, we explicitly encode vascular features into an end-to-end loss function for multi-class vessel segmentation, categorising pixels into artery, vein, uncertain pixels, and background. This clinically-relevant feature optimised loss function (CF-Loss) regulates networks to segment accurate multi-class vessel maps that produce precise vascular features. Our experiments first verify that CF-Loss significantly improves both multi-class vessel segmentation and vascular feature estimation, with two standard segmentation networks, on three publicly available datasets. We reveal that pixel-based segmentation performance is not always positively correlated with accuracy of vascular features, thus highlighting the importance of optimising vascular features directly via CF-Loss. Finally, we show that improved vascular features from CF-Loss, as biomarkers, can yield quantitative improvements in the prediction of ischaemic stroke, a real-world clinical downstream task.

Here, we explore that relationship for spatial networks with radial symmetry and disordered fractal morphology. Under a geometric graphs approach, we quantify the effectiveness of the exchange of information in the system from center to perimeter and over the entire network structure. We mainly consider two paradigmatic models of disordered fractal formation, the Ballistic Aggregation and Diffusion-Limited Aggregation models, and complementary, the Viscek and Hexaflake fractals, and Kagome and Hexagonal lattices. First, we show that complex tree morphologies provide important advantages over regular configurations, such as an invariant structural cost for different fractal dimensions. Furthermore, although these systems are known to be scale-free in space, they have bounded degree distributions for different values of an euclidean connectivity parameter and, therefore, do not represent ordinary scale-free networks. Finally, compared to regular structures, fractal trees are fragile and overall inefficient as expected, however, we show that this efficiency can become similar to that of a robust hexagonal lattice, at a similar cost, by just considering a very short euclidean connectivity beyond first neighbors.",Partial financial support by CONACyT Mexico through the Grant A1-S-39909 is acknowledged.

The purpose of this study is to propose a no-contact and efficient method for the measurement of the roughness of concrete fracture surfaces based on fringe-projection technology. A simple phase-correction method using one additional strip image is presented for the phase unwrapping to improve the measurement efficiency and accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the measuring error for plane height is less than 0.1mm, and the relative accuracy for measuring a cylindrical object is about 0.1%, meeting the requirements for concrete fracture-surface measurement. On this basis, three-dimensional reconstructions were carried out on various concrete fracture surfaces to evaluate the roughness. The results reveal that the surface roughness (R) and fractal dimension (D) decrease as the concrete strength increases or the water-to-cement ratio decreases, consistent with previous studies. In addition, compared with the surface roughness, the fractal dimension is more sensitive to the change in concrete surface shape. The proposed method is effective for detecting concrete fracture-surface features.",,"This research was funded by Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, grant number 2022A1515010769.",Materials,,Francesco Fabbrocino,,2023-06-16,2023,2023-06-16,,16,12,4430,,,"Dai, Meiling; Wang, Xirui; Cheng, Cheng; Chen, Zhuoli; Deng, Jiyu","Dai, Meiling (School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China;, meiling-dai@163.com, (M.D.);, 15859919698@163.com, (X.W.);, 1216416395cchh@gmail.com, (C.C.);, 18438596038@163.com, (Z.C.)); Wang, Xirui (School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China;, meiling-dai@163.com, (M.D.);, 15859919698@163.com, (X.W.);, 1216416395cchh@gmail.com, (C.C.);, 18438596038@163.com, (Z.C.)); Cheng, Cheng (School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China;, meiling-dai@163.com, (M.D.);, 15859919698@163.com, (X.W.);, 1216416395cchh@gmail.com, (C.C.);, 18438596038@163.com, (Z.C.)); Chen, Zhuoli (School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China;, meiling-dai@163.com, (M.D.);, 15859919698@163.com, (X.W.);, 1216416395cchh@gmail.com, (C.C.);, 18438596038@163.com, (Z.C.)); Deng, Jiyu (School of Architecture and Urban Planning, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510080, China)","Deng, Jiyu (Guangdong University of Technology)","Dai, Meiling (Guangdong University of Technology; School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China;, meiling-dai@163.com, (M.D.);, 15859919698@163.com, (X.W.);, 1216416395cchh@gmail.com, (C.C.);, 18438596038@163.com, (Z.C.)); Wang, Xirui (Guangdong University of Technology; School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China;, meiling-dai@163.com, (M.D.);, 15859919698@163.com, (X.W.);, 1216416395cchh@gmail.com, (C.C.);, 18438596038@163.com, (Z.C.)); Cheng, Cheng (Guangdong University of Technology; School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China;, meiling-dai@163.com, (M.D.);, 15859919698@163.com, (X.W.);, 1216416395cchh@gmail.com, (C.C.);, 18438596038@163.com, (Z.C.)); Chen, Zhuoli (Guangdong University of Technology; School of Civil and Transportation Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China;, meiling-dai@163.com, (M.D.);, 15859919698@163.com, (X.W.);, 1216416395cchh@gmail.com, (C.C.);, 18438596038@163.com, (Z.C.)); Deng, Jiyu (Guangdong University of Technology)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/12/4430/pdf?version=1686904588,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159896638,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

The migration mechanism of water and chloride ions restricted in C-S-H nanopores is complicated due to the presence of interfacial effects. The special mechanical properties of the solid-liquid interface determine the importance of boundary slip and Electric Double Layer (EDL) and ion diversity in pore solutions determines the difference of the EDL and the stability of water film slip. A cross-scale model covering slip effects, time-varying of EDL and ion correlation needs to be developed so that the interfacial effects concentrated at the pore scale can be extended to affect the overall diffusivity of C-S-H. The statistics of pore size distribution and fractal dimension were used to quantitatively compare the similarities between model and C-S-H structure, thus proving the reliability of cross-scale reconstructed C-S-H transmission model. The results show that the slip effect is the dominant factor affecting the diffusion ability of C-S-H, the contribution of the slip effect is up to 60% and the contribution rate of EDL time-varying only up to about 15%. Moreover, the slip effect is sensitive to both ion correlation and C-S-H inhomogeneity and EDL time-varying is almost insensitive to ion correlation changes. This quantification provides a necessary benchmark for understanding the destructiveness of cement-based materials in the salt rich environment and provides new insights into improving the durability of concrete by changing the solid-liquid interface on the micro-nanoscale.",,This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 12072363).,Materials,,,,2022-11-21,2022,2022-11-21,,15,22,8253,,,"Qi, Yunchao; Peng, Weihong; Zhang, Wei; Jing, Yawen; Hu, Liangyu","Qi, Yunchao (School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China); Peng, Weihong (State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China); Zhang, Wei (State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China); Jing, Yawen (School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China); Hu, Liangyu (School of Mechanics and Civil Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China)","Peng, Weihong (China University of Mining and Technology)","Qi, Yunchao (China University of Mining and Technology); Peng, Weihong (China University of Mining and Technology); Zhang, Wei (China University of Mining and Technology); Jing, Yawen (China University of Mining and Technology); Hu, Liangyu (China University of Mining and Technology)",0,0,,0.0,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/22/8253/pdf?version=1669015013,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152935531,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Methods: A prospective study was performed of 49 eyes from 49 diabetic patients without clinical signs of DR and a control group of 52 eyes from 52 healthy normal individuals. The 3 × 3 mm macular scans and 4.5 × 4.5 mm optic disc scans were obtained with the OCTA RTVue-XR Avanti system. Angiograms from the superficial capillary plexus, the deep capillary plexus of the macula scans, and radial peripapillary capillary plexus of the optic disc scans were analyzed with MATLAB. Multivariate binary logistic regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select ideal parameters that distinguish diabetic eyes without DR from normal eyes. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated.
Results: Our final model identified FD-300 (foveal vessel density in a 300-µm-wide region around foveal avascular zone) as the only parameter selected by both the LASSO regression and the final multivariate logistic regression model that significantly differentiates diabetic eyes without clinical signs of DR from healthy normal eyes. The area under the ROC curve of FD-300 was 0.685, and sensitivity and specificity were 65.3% and 71.2%, respectively.
Conclusions: Quantitative evaluation of retinal microvascular abnormalities using OCTA identified FD-300 as a useful biomarker versus the other macular and peripapillary OCTA metrics in the early detection of preclinical diabetic retinal abnormalities.
Translational Relevance: OCTA may be useful in detecting early retinal microvascular abnormalities in diabetic patients before the clinical findings of DR become visible.","Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 81971697, 81501544, 81200697), the Scientific Research Project of Hunan Provincial Health Commission (grant no. 202107020970), and the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (grant no. 2021JJ30982).

The research results show that the wavelet hard thresholding method has the best noise reduction effect on the original signal, and the box counting dimension has a strong waveform identification effect. Before deformation damage occurs, fractal spectral width Δα shows an increase and then decrease and the fluctuation scale factor Δf(α) decreases and then increases. When damage occurs, fractal spectral width Δα decreases and then stabilizes and concentrates. Simultaneously, the fluctuation scale factor Δf(α) keeps decreasing until the lowest point, and then shows an increasing trend until it reaches a stable state.

Methods: Individuals with an expert-confirmed clinical diagnosis of PD and controls with normal cognition without PD underwent Optos California UWF imaging. Patients with diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, glaucoma, dementia, other movement disorders, or known retinal or optic nerve pathology were excluded. Images were analyzed using Vasculature Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the Retina (VAMPIRE-UWF) software, which describes retinal vessel width gradient and tortuosity, provides vascular network fractal dimensions, and conducts alpha-shape analysis to further characterize vascular morphology (complexity, Opαmin; spread, OpA).
Results: In the PD cohort, 53 eyes of 38 subjects were assessed; in the control cohort, 51 eyes of 33 subjects were assessed. Eyes with PD had more tortuous retinal arteries in the superotemporal quadrant (P = 0.043). In eyes with PD, alpha-shape analysis revealed decreased OpA, indicating less retinal vasculature spread compared to controls (P = 0.032). Opαmin was decreased in PD (P = 0.044), suggesting increased vascular network complexity. No differences were observed in fractal dimension in any region of interest.
Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that retinal vasculature assessment on UWF images using alpha-shape analysis reveals differences in retinal vascular network spread and complexity in PD and may be a more sensitive metric compared to fractal dimension.
Translational Relevance: Retinal vasculature assessment using these novel methods may be useful in understanding ocular manifestations of PD and the development of retinal biomarkers.","Our additional acknowledgments go to the members of the iMIND Study Group Team who were involved in some capacity in this work.

However, it is difficult to effectively obtain a large number of SWCCs because of the cumbersome and expensive determination experiments for SWCCs. Pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) established using soil physicochemical properties have become an effective method for solving this problem. However, due to the limitations of the establishment methods and the wide spatial variability of soil properties, it is still difficult to establish PTFs in a specific region. In order to establish the PTFs of SWCCs for the alluvial plain area of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, 233 soil samples were collected from the vadose zone in a typical area. These data were used as the data sources, and eight variables including clay, silt content, fractal dimension, bulk density, total porosity, pH value, organic matter content, and electrical conductivity were used as the influencing factors. By applying and comparing three machine learning algorithms, the PTFs of the SWCCs based on the random forest algorithm were obtained. Based on the Gini index of the random forest, the insensitive factors were eliminated and the optimal variable input mode was constructed. Based on the verification, there was little difference between the predicted water content and the measured water content. The determination coefficient R2 is 0.9308; the root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.0447; and the mean relative error (MRE) is 22.40%.","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41972261), and the authors would like to thank Wang Lin and others at the Henan Institute of Geological Environment Monitoring for providing assistance with the field sampling for this study.",,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,,,Clay; Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Rivers; Soil; Water,2022-10-06,2022,2022-10-06,2022-12,194,12,850,,,"Zhan, Jiang; Li, Zhiping; Yu, Xiaopeng; Zhao, Guizhang; Yuan, Qiaoling","Zhan, Jiang (College of Geosciences and Engineering, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, 450045, Zhengzhou, China; Yellow River Engineering Consulting Co, 450045, Ltd, Zhengzhou, China); Li, Zhiping (College of Geosciences and Engineering, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, 450045, Zhengzhou, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Efficient Utilization of Water Resources in Henan Province, 450045, Zhengzhou, China); Yu, Xiaopeng (College of Geosciences and Engineering, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, 450045, Zhengzhou, China); Zhao, Guizhang (College of Geosciences and Engineering, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, 450045, Zhengzhou, China); Yuan, Qiaoling (College of Geosciences and Engineering, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, 450045, Zhengzhou, China)","Li, Zhiping (North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power; Collaborative Innovation Center for Efficient Utilization of Water Resources in Henan Province, 450045, Zhengzhou, China)","Zhan, Jiang (North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power; Yellow River Engineering Consulting (China)); Li, Zhiping (North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power; Collaborative Innovation Center for Efficient Utilization of Water Resources in Henan Province, 450045, Zhengzhou, China); Yu, Xiaopeng (North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power); Zhao, Guizhang (North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power); Yuan, Qiaoling (North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power)",2,2,0.97,1.22,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151618702,37 Earth Sciences; 3707 Hydrology; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4106 Soil Sciences,

We aimed to compare jawbone trabeculation between patients on drug holiday with those not on drug holiday among Medication Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ) cases using fractal analysis and to estimate the frequency of MRONJ despite being on drug holiday.
Material and Methods: The sample of 18 MRONJ cases were divided into drug holiday, and non-drug holiday groups. Non-drug holiday group was further divided into pre- and post- drug holiday groups. Jawbone trabeculation was assessed utilizing fractal analysis method (ImageJ software) by two observers. ANOVA was used to compare the fractal dimension (FD) values between the groups. A 'p' value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: 8 patients developed MRONJ despite being on drug holiday (44.44%). There was no significant difference in the FD values between drug holiday and pre-drug holiday groups. When pre- and post-drug holiday FD values were compared, the difference was significant only on the right maxilla with observer 2. Also, no significant difference was noted between the two observers.
Conclusions: Bone trabeculation remained unaltered following drug holiday from anti-resorptive drugs. This study serves as a preliminary proof for the argument against drug holiday which portrays the necessity for a detailed prospective study in this arena.

Spatial autocorrelation coefficients including Moran's index proved to be an eigenvalue of the spatial correlation matrixes. An eigenvalue represents a kind of characteristic length for quantitative analysis. However, if a spatial correlation process is based on self-organized evolution, complex structure, and the distributions without characteristic scale, the eigenvalue will be ineffective. In this case, a scaling exponent such as fractal dimension can be used to compensate for the shortcoming of characteristic length parameters such as Moran's index.
METHOD: This paper is devoted to finding an intrinsic relationship between Moran's index and fractal dimension by means of spatial correlation modeling. Using relative step function as spatial contiguity function, we can convert spatial autocorrelation coefficients into spatial autocorrelation functions.
RESULT: By decomposition of spatial autocorrelation functions, we can derive the relation between spatial correlation dimension and spatial autocorrelation functions. As results, a series of useful mathematical models are constructed, including the functional relation between Moran's index and fractal parameters. Correlation dimension proved to be a scaling exponent in the spatial correlation equation based on Moran's index. As for empirical analysis, the scaling exponent of spatial autocorrelation of Chinese cities is Dc = 1.3623±0.0358, which is equal to the spatial correlation dimension of the same urban system, D2. The goodness of fit is about R2 = 0.9965. This fractal parameter value suggests weak spatial autocorrelation of Chinese cities.
CONCLUSION: A conclusion can be drawn that we can utilize spatial correlation dimension to make deep spatial autocorrelation analysis, and employ spatial autocorrelation functions to make complex spatial autocorrelation analysis. This study reveals the inherent association of fractal patterns with spatial autocorrelation processes. The work may inspire new ideas for spatial modeling and exploration of complex systems such as cities.",I would like to thank the anonymous reviewer and Dr. Ejigu whose interesting and constructive comments were very helpful in improving the quality of this paper.,"The author received specific funding for this work from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Award Number: 42171192; Recipient: Yanguang Chen).

Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among ocular treatment-naïve healthy participants from Guangzhou, China. FD and BVT in the superficial capillary plexus and deep capillary plexus were measured by SS-OCTA with a 3 × 3 macula model. eGFR was calculated using the Xiangya equation, and impaired renal function (IRF) was defined as eGFR = 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Linear regression was performed to evaluate the relationships between SS-OCTA metrics and renal function.
Results: A total of 729 participants with a mean age of 57.6 ± 9.1 years were included in the final analysis. Compared to participants with normal renal function, those with IRF had lower FD both in the superficial capillary plexus (1.658 ± 0.029 vs. 1.666 ± 0.024, p = 0.001) and deep capillary plexus (1.741 ± 0.016 vs. 1.746 ± 0.016, p = 0.0003), while the deep BVT was larger in participants with IRF than those with normal renal function (1.007 ± 0.002 vs. 1.006 ± 0.002, p = 0.028). The superficial FD was linearly and positively associated with eGFR after adjusting for confounders (β = 0.2257; 95% CI 0.0829-0.3685; p = 0.002), while BVT was not associated with eGFR (all p ≥ 0.05).
Conclusion: The patients with IRF had lower FD and larger BVT than those with normal renal function. The superficial FD decreased linearly with renal function deterioration. Our study suggests that the retinal microvasculature can represent a useful indicator of subclinical renal microvascular abnormalities and serve as a useful non-invasive assessment to predict and monitor the progression of renal function.",,"This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82171084; 82000901; and 81900866), the Guangzhou Science and Technology Plan of Guangdong Pearl River Talents Program (202102010162), and the Fundamental Research Funds of the State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology (303060202400362).",Frontiers in Medicine,,,,2022-09-02,2022,2022-09-02,,9,,925756,,,"Wu, Linbin; Gong, Xia; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Lei; Zhou, Jiachen; Ming, Xi; Yuan, Meng; Huang, Wenyong; Wang, Lanhua","Wu, Linbin (The First People’s Hospital of Zhaoqing, Zhaoqing, China); Gong, Xia (Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China); Wang, Wei (Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China); Zhang, Lei (The First People’s Hospital of Zhaoqing, Zhaoqing, China); Zhou, Jiachen (The First People’s Hospital of Zhaoqing, Zhaoqing, China); Ming, Xi (The First People’s Hospital of Zhaoqing, Zhaoqing, China); Yuan, Meng (Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China); Huang, Wenyong (Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China); Wang, Lanhua (Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China)","Huang, Wenyong (Sun Yat-sen University); Wang, Lanhua (Sun Yat-sen University)","Wu, Linbin (The First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing); Gong, Xia (Sun Yat-sen University); Wang, Wei (Sun Yat-sen University); Zhang, Lei (The First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing); Zhou, Jiachen (The First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing); Ming, Xi (The First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing); Yuan, Meng (Sun Yat-sen University); Huang, Wenyong (Sun Yat-sen University); Wang, Lanhua (Sun Yat-sen University)",2,2,0.26,1.76,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.925756/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150681496,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,

The 3 × 3 mm macular OCT angiography images were analyzed using the Fiji software to obtain the vessel density, skeleton density, average vessel diameter, vessel tortuosity, fractal dimension, and foveal avascular zone (FAZ)-related parameters. The correlations between these parameters and ERM grading as well as visual acuity were analyzed.ResultsFor ERM with or without a pseudohole, increased average vessel diameter, decreased skeleton density, and decreased vessel tortuosity were all associated with inner retinal folding and thickened inner nuclear layer, indicating more severe ERM. In 191 eyes without a pseudohole, the average vessel diameter increased, fractal dimension decreased and vessel tortuosity decreased with increasing ERM severity. The FAZ was not associated with ERM severity. Decreased skeleton density (r = -0.37), vessel tortuosity (r = -0.35), and increased average vessel diameter (r = 0.42) were correlated with worse visual acuity (All P < 0.001). In 58 eyes with pseudoholes, a larger FAZ was associated with a smaller average vessel diameter (r = -0.43, P = 0.015), higher skeleton density (r = 0.49, P < 0.001), and vessel tortuosity (r = 0.32, P = 0.015). However, none of the retinal vasculature parameters correlated with visual acuity and central foveal thickness.ConclusionIncreased average vessel diameter, decreased skeleton density, decreased fractal dimension and decreased vessel tortuosity were good indicators of ERM severity and associated visual impairment.","We thank the staff of the Department of Medical Research, National Taiwan University Hospital for the Integrative Medical Database (NTUH-iMD).",The authors have no funding sources to declare.,BMC Ophthalmology,,,"Humans; Epiretinal Membrane; Fovea Centralis; Retinal Vessels; Macula Lutea; Retina; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Retrospective Studies; Fluorescein Angiography",2023-05-05,2023,2023-05-05,,23,1,200,,,"Hsia, Yun; Hsieh, Yi-Ting","Hsia, Yun (Department of Ophthalmology, National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Hsinchu, Taiwan; Department of Ophthalmology, National Taiwan University Hospital, No 7, Chung-Shan S.

In order to study the possibility of exploiting tailings sand, available in large quantities in sand concrete, and find an approach to improve the toughness of sand concrete by selecting appropriate fine aggregate. Three distinct fine aggregates have been used. After characterizing the fine aggregate used, the mechanical properties were tested to characterize the toughness of sand concrete, the box-counting fractal dimensions were calculated to analyze the roughness of fracture surfaces, and the microstructure was tested to observe the path and width of microcracks and hydration products in sand concrete. The results show that the mineral composition of fine aggregates is close, but their fineness modulus, fine aggregate angularity (FAA) and gradation vary considerably; FAA has a significant impact on the fracture toughness of sand concrete. The higher the FAA value, the more resistant it is to crack expansion; with the FAA values of from 32 s to 44 s, the microcrack width in sand concrete was reduced from 0.25 um to 0.14 um; The fracture toughness and microstructure of sand concrete are also related to the gradation of fine aggregates, the better gradation can improve the performance of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ). The hydration products in the ITZ are also different because more reasonable gradation of aggregates reduces the voids between the fine aggregates and the cement paste and restrains the full growth of crystals.

This study conducted the combination experiments of moisture equilibrium and prefreezing nitrogen adsorption-desorption to explore the adsorption behavior of water in coal pores and thus to reveal the distribution characteristics of water in pores with different scales as well as the influence of water on pore structures. The results showed that the adsorption mechanism of water vapor undergoes a transition from monolayer to multilayer to condensation with the increase in relative humidity (RH). The occurrence characteristics of adsorbed water in coal pores are controlled by the RH and pore size. When the RH is increased from 0 to 98%, the nitrogen adsorption capacity, specific surface area, and effective pore volume of the samples were all decreased significantly due to the different adsorption modes of water, which is more significant in pores with d < 10 nm. Additionally, the relative pressure corresponding to the branching position of the nitrogen adsorption-desorption curve will be changed with the increase in moisture content. Based on this, it is calculated that the adsorbed water will change the smoothness of the pore wall and the complexity of the pore structure.","The authors acknowledge the funds provided by Guizhou University (Number: 702825), the Science and Technology Program of Guizhou Province (Qian Science Foundation- ZK [2022] General 106, Qian Science Cooperation Project of Prospecting Strategy [2022] ZD001), National Natural Science Foundation Project of China (No. 42002166), and Geological Exploration Fund Project of Guizhou Province (No. 52000021 MGQSE7S7K6PRP).",,ACS Omega,,,,2023-10-30,2023,2023-10-30,2023-11-14,8,45,42379-42389,,,"Li, Zhixuan; Wang, Ke; Lou, Yi; Xia, Peng; Shao, Linjie; Hu, Haiyang; Gao, Wei","Li, Zhixuan (College of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China); Wang, Ke (College of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China); Lou, Yi (Guizhou Panjiang Coalbed Methane Development and Utilization Company Limited, Guiyang, 550081, China); Xia, Peng (College of Resources and Environmental Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China); Shao, Linjie (Guizhou Panjiang Coalbed Methane Development and Utilization Company Limited, Guiyang, 550081, China); Hu, Haiyang (Guizhou Engineering Technology Research Center for Coalbed Methane and Shale Gas, Guiyang, 550009, China); Gao, Wei (Guizhou Engineering Technology Research Center for Coalbed Methane and Shale Gas, Guiyang, 550009, China)","Wang, Ke (Guizhou University)","Li, Zhixuan (Guizhou University); Wang, Ke (Guizhou University); Lou, Yi (Guizhou Panjiang Coalbed Methane Development and Utilization Company Limited, Guiyang, 550081, China); Xia, Peng (Guizhou University); Shao, Linjie (Guizhou Panjiang Coalbed Methane Development and Utilization Company Limited, Guiyang, 550081, China); Hu, Haiyang (Guizhou Engineering Technology Research Center for Coalbed Methane and Shale Gas, Guiyang, 550009, China); Gao, Wei (Guizhou Engineering Technology Research Center for Coalbed Methane and Shale Gas, Guiyang, 550009, China)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c04621,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165346485,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering,

However, the process of pumping fracturing fluid (FF) into the reservoir unavoidably causes damage to the surrounding matrix, leading to a decrease in the overall stimulation effect. To assess the extent of matrix permeability damage caused by the intrusion of FF, as well as its impact on the pore throat structure, and to propose appropriate measures to control this damage, we conducted a series of experimental studies on tight gas reservoirs. These studies included mercury intrusion, core flow, nitrogen adsorption, linear expansion, and contact angle measurements. The findings revealed that the damage inflicted on matrix permeability by FF was significantly greater than that caused by its gel-breaking counterpart. Surprisingly, the damage rate of the rejecting fluid to the matrix was found to be comparable to that of its gel-breaking counterpart. The fractal dimension (D2) was observed to have a strong correlation with surface area, pore volume, and mean pore size, making it an effective means of characterizing pore structure characteristics. After the rock samples were displaced by the formation water, the D2 value decreased, leading to a decrease in the complexity of the pore throat structure and an increase in matrix permeability. Conversely, the displacement of the FF increased the D2 value, indicating a gradual complication of the pore throat structure and a more uneven distribution of pore sizes. The inclusion of polyamide in antiexpansion FF, as well as its gel-breaking counterpart, proved to be effective in inhibiting the hydration and expansion of clay minerals, thereby reducing water-sensitive damage. Additionally, the use of surfactants with low surface tension enhanced the flowback rate of FF by increasing the contact angle and reducing the work of adhesion. This, in turn, helped to decrease the apparent water film thickness and expand gas flow channels, ultimately improving gas permeability.",This work is supported financially by the postdoctoral research program of Petrochina Southwest Oil &amp; Gas Field Company (Grant No. 20220302-20).,,ACS Omega,,,,2023-09-27,2023,2023-09-27,2023-10-10,8,40,37461-37470,,,"Zhang, Xueping; Liu, Youquan; Zhou, Lang; Zhong, Chuanrong; Zhang, Pengfei","Zhang, Xueping (Research Institute of Natural Gas Technology, PetroChina Southwest Oil & Gas Field Company, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610213, China; College of Energy, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, 610059, P.

Design: Prospective cross sectional study.
Participants: One hundred thirty-one eyes of 82 MCI patients and 230 eyes of 133 cognitively normal participants from the Eye Multimodal Imaging in Neurodegenerative Disease Study.
Methods: A scanning laser ophthalmoscope (California, Optos Inc) was used to obtain UWF fundus color images. Images were analyzed with the Vasculature Assessment Platform for Images of the Retina UWF (VAMPIRE-UWF 2.0, Universities of Edinburgh and Dundee) software.
Main outcome measures: Imaging parameters included vessel width gradient, vessel width intercept, large vessel choroidal vascular density, vessel tortuosity, and vessel fractal dimension.
Results: Both retinal artery and vein width gradients were less negative in MCI patients compared with controls, demonstrating decreased rates of vessel thinning at the periphery (P < 0.001; P = 0.027). Retinal artery and vein width intercepts, a metric that extrapolates the width of the vessel at the center of the optic disc, were smaller in MCI patients compared with that of controls (P < 0.001; P = 0.017). The large vessel choroidal vascular density, which quantifies the vascular area versus the total choroidal area, was greater in MCI patients compared with controls (P = 0.025).
Conclusions: When compared with controls with normal cognition, MCI patients had thinner retinal vasculature manifested in both the retinal arteries and the veins. In MCI, these thinner arteries and veins attenuated at a lower rate when traveling toward the periphery. MCI patients also had increased choroidal vascular density.

METHOD AND MATERIALS: A total of 49 patients with celiac disease aged 6 to 13 years, separated into two groups as previously and newly diagnosed, and a control group of 32 healthy individuals were evaluated. In previously and newly diagnosed patients with celiac disease, body mass index Z-scores were calculated, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D3, and parathormone levels were measured, and bone mineral density Z-scores were obtained from dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. In all patients, the fractal dimensions of the right and left temporomandibular condyles were evaluated with the fractal analysis method on panoramic radiographs.
RESULTS: The mean values of serum biomarker levels and the body mass index and bone mineral density Z-scores for both celiac groups were within the normal reference range. No statistically significant difference was determined between right and left condyle fractal dimensions values in the three groups examined. In terms of both right and left condyle fractal dimensions values, there was a statistically significant difference between groups. The highest fractal dimensions values were determined in the previously diagnosed group.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in fractal dimensions values were observed among patients with celiac disease following the gluten-free diet. Utilizing fractal analysis on panoramic radiographs can prove valuable for dental practitioners in evaluating bone mineral density due to its cost-effectiveness, easy accessibility, and reduced radiation exposure for patients, enabling them to provide comprehensive oral health care and potential early interventions for patients with celiac disease.",,,Quintessence International,,,"Child; Humans; Celiac Disease; Bone Density; Fractals; Dentists; Professional Role; Bone and Bones; Radiography, Panoramic",2023-11-28,2023,,2023-11-28,54,10,822-831,,,"Bulut, Muge; Tokuc, Muge; Aydin, Merve Nur; Ayyildiz Civan, Hasret; Polat, Esra; Dogan, Guzide; Altuntas, Cansu; Bayrak, Nevzat Aykut; Beser, Omer Faruk","Bulut, Muge (); Tokuc, Muge (); Aydin, Merve Nur (); Ayyildiz Civan, Hasret (); Polat, Esra (); Dogan, Guzide (); Altuntas, Cansu (); Bayrak, Nevzat Aykut (); Beser, Omer Faruk ()",,"Bulut, Muge (); Tokuc, Muge (); Aydin, Merve Nur (); Ayyildiz Civan, Hasret (); Polat, Esra (); Dogan, Guzide (); Altuntas, Cansu (); Bayrak, Nevzat Aykut (); Beser, Omer Faruk ()",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163413009,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

While for dissolved contaminants partition or sorption coefficients are used, the underlying assumption of chemical equilibrium is invalid for particulate contaminants, such as engineered nanomaterials, incidental nanoparticles, micro- or nanoplastics. Their interactions with SPM are governed by physicochemical forces between contaminant-particle and SPM surfaces. The availability of a standard SPM material is thus highly relevant for the development of reproducible test systems to evaluate the fate of particulate contaminants in aquatic systems. Finding suitable SPM analogues, however, is challenging considering the complex composition of natural SPM, which features floc-like structures comprising minerals and organic components from the molecular to the microorganism level. Complex composition comes with a heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties, that cannot be neglected. We developed a procedure to generate SPM analogue flocs from components selected to represent the most abundant and crucial constituents of natural riverine SPM, and the process-relevant SPM surface characteristics regarding interactions with particulate contaminants. Four components, i.e., illite, hematite, quartz and tryptophan, combined at environmentally realistic mass-ratios, were associated to complex flocs. Flocculation was reproducible regarding floc size and fractal dimension, and multiple tests on floc resilience towards physical impacts (agitation, sedimentation-storage-resuspension, dilution) and hydrochemical changes (pH, electrolytes, dissolved organic matter concentration) confirmed their robustness. These reproducible, ready-to-use SPM analogue flocs will strongly support future research on emerging particulate contaminants.","We sincerely thank Nathalie Tepe, Vesna Micic Batka and Gerlinde Habler for SEM imaging.

In this paper, a particular geometric model of point clustering approaching the Cantor shape in 2D, with a symmetry scale θ being an intermittency parameter, is proposed. To verify its ability to describe intermittency, to this model, we applied the entropic skin theory concept. This allowed us to obtain a conceptual validation. We observed that the intermittency phenomenon in our model was adequately described with the multiscale dynamics proposed by the entropic skin theory, coupling the fluctuation levels that extended between two extremes: the bulk and the crest. We calculated the reversibility efficiency γ with two different methods: statistical and geometrical analyses. Both efficiency values, γstat and γgeo, showed equality with a low relative error margin, which actually validated our suggested fractal model for intermittency. In addition, we applied the extended self-similarity (E.S.S.) to the model. This highlighted the intermittency phenomenon as a deviation from the homogeneity assumed by Kolmogorov in turbulence.",,This research received no external funding.,Entropy,,,,2023-05-03,2023,2023-05-03,,25,5,749,,,"Tarraf, Walid; Queiros-Condé, Diogo; Ribeiro, Patrick; Absi, Rafik","Tarraf, Walid (Laboratory of Research in Industrial Eco-Innovation and Energetic (LR2E), Ecole Supérieure d’Ingénieurs ECAM-EPMI, 13 Bd de l’Hautil, 95000 Cergy, France;, r.absi@ecam-epmi.com; Laboratory of Energetics Mechanics and Electromagnetism (LEME), Université Paris Nanterre, Pôle de Ville d’Avray, 50 rue de Sèvres, 92410 Ville d’Avray, France;, dqueiros-conde@parisnanterre.fr, (D.Q.-C.);, patrick.ribeiro@live.fr, (P.R.)); Queiros-Condé, Diogo (Laboratory of Energetics Mechanics and Electromagnetism (LEME), Université Paris Nanterre, Pôle de Ville d’Avray, 50 rue de Sèvres, 92410 Ville d’Avray, France;, dqueiros-conde@parisnanterre.fr, (D.Q.-C.);, patrick.ribeiro@live.fr, (P.R.)); Ribeiro, Patrick (Laboratory of Energetics Mechanics and Electromagnetism (LEME), Université Paris Nanterre, Pôle de Ville d’Avray, 50 rue de Sèvres, 92410 Ville d’Avray, France;, dqueiros-conde@parisnanterre.fr, (D.Q.-C.);, patrick.ribeiro@live.fr, (P.R.)); Absi, Rafik (Laboratory of Research in Industrial Eco-Innovation and Energetic (LR2E), Ecole Supérieure d’Ingénieurs ECAM-EPMI, 13 Bd de l’Hautil, 95000 Cergy, France;, r.absi@ecam-epmi.com)","Tarraf, Walid (ECAM-EPMI; University Paris Nanterre; Laboratory of Energetics Mechanics and Electromagnetism (LEME), Université Paris Nanterre, Pôle de Ville d’Avray, 50 rue de Sèvres, 92410 Ville d’Avray, France;, dqueiros-conde@parisnanterre.fr, (D.Q.-C.);, patrick.ribeiro@live.fr, (P.R.))","Tarraf, Walid (ECAM-EPMI; University Paris Nanterre; Laboratory of Energetics Mechanics and Electromagnetism (LEME), Université Paris Nanterre, Pôle de Ville d’Avray, 50 rue de Sèvres, 92410 Ville d’Avray, France;, dqueiros-conde@parisnanterre.fr, (D.Q.-C.);, patrick.ribeiro@live.fr, (P.R.)); Queiros-Condé, Diogo (University Paris Nanterre; Laboratory of Energetics Mechanics and Electromagnetism (LEME), Université Paris Nanterre, Pôle de Ville d’Avray, 50 rue de Sèvres, 92410 Ville d’Avray, France;, dqueiros-conde@parisnanterre.fr, (D.Q.-C.);, patrick.ribeiro@live.fr, (P.R.)); Ribeiro, Patrick (University Paris Nanterre; Laboratory of Energetics Mechanics and Electromagnetism (LEME), Université Paris Nanterre, Pôle de Ville d’Avray, 50 rue de Sèvres, 92410 Ville d’Avray, France;, dqueiros-conde@parisnanterre.fr, (D.Q.-C.);, patrick.ribeiro@live.fr, (P.R.)); Absi, Rafik (ECAM-EPMI)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/5/749/pdf?version=1683107983,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157807519,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,

Fast Lubrication Dynamics (FLD) and simple Brownian Dynamics (BD) methods have also been employed to assess the importance of long range hydrodynamic interactions on the resulting dynamics. It has been observed that long-range hydrodynamic interactions are essential to capture the fast aggregation rates induced by the increase in sedimentation rate of clusters with increasing mass, which manifests with an explosive-like cluster growth after a given induction time. On the contrary, simulations employing only short-range hydrodynamic interactions (such as FLD) and BD (which neglects completely hydrodynamic interactions) are incapable of predicting this very rapid kinetics, because sedimentation simply leads to all particles and clusters moving vertically with identical velocity. It has been observed that at high volume fractions and low Pe values, a gel point can be formed and a phase diagram predicting when gelation is reached has been obtained. It was also observed that, as Pe increases, the anisotropy of the resulting clusters decreases, suggesting that denser clusters with spherical-like morphology are formed due to cluster breakage and restructuring. We can conclude that long-range hydrodynamic effects are of crucial importance in understanding the aggregation dynamics of settling clusters, revealing important features of the complex interplay between sedimentation, and colloidal interactions.",Financial support from the University of Fribourg is kindly acknowledged.,,Soft Matter,,,,2022-02-23,2022,2022,2022-02-23,18,8,1715-1730,,,"Turetta, Lorenzo; Lattuada, Marco","Turetta, Lorenzo (Department of Chemistry, University of Fribourg, Chemin du Musée 9, 1700 Fribourg, Switzerland. lorenzo.turetta@unifr.ch.); Lattuada, Marco (Department of Chemistry, University of Fribourg, Chemin du Musée 9, 1700 Fribourg, Switzerland. lorenzo.turetta@unifr.ch.)",,"Turetta, Lorenzo (University of Fribourg); Lattuada, Marco (University of Fribourg)",12,12,2.24,3.13,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1sm01637g,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144971853,34 Chemical Sciences; 3406 Physical Chemistry; 40 Engineering,

Despite extensive research in the past few decades, the fundamental process of sulfur-rich asphaltene aggregation still remains not fully understood. In this work, we have investigated the particle-by-particle growth of aggregates formed with sulfur-rich asphaltene by a combined approach of in situ microscopy and molecular simulation. The experimental results show that aggregates assembled from sulfur-rich asphaltene have morphologies with time-dependent structural self-similarity, and their growth rates are aligned with a crossover behavior between classic reaction-limited aggregation and diffusion-limited aggregation. Although the particle size distribution predicted using the Smoluchowski equation deviates from the observations at the initial stage, it provides a reasonable prediction of aggregate size distribution at the later stage, even if the observed cluster coalescence has an important effect on the corresponding cluster size distribution. The simulation results show that aliphatic sulfur exerts nonmonotonic effects on asphaltene nanoaggregate formation depending on the asphaltene molecular structure. Specifically, aliphatic sulfur has a profound effect on the structure of rod-like nanoaggregates, especially when asphaltene molecules have small aromatic cores. Interactions between aliphatic sulfur and the side chain of neighboring molecules account for the repulsive forces that largely explain the polydispersity in the nanoaggregates and corresponding colloidal aggregates. These results can improve our current understanding of the complex process of sulfur-rich asphaltene aggregation and sheds light on designing efficient crude oil utilization and remediation technologies.",L.W. would like to acknowledge the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant 1836905.

Our analyses are based on the product-like fractal measure concept introduced by Li and Ostoja-Starzewski in their attempt to explore anisotropic fractal elastic media and electromagnetic fields. The mathematical model presented in the paper is formulated for only a part of a single nerve cell (an axon). The analytical and numerical envelop soliton of this equation are reported. The results obtained prove the emergence of lump-type solitonic waves in nerves and biomembranes. In particular, these waves decay algebraically to the background wave in space direction.

METHODS: The high groundwater level (0.7-0.9 m), medium groundwater level (1.1-1.3 m) and low groundwater level (1.5-1.7 m) T. chinensis forests on the beaches of the Yellow River Delta were used as the research objects. Full excavation methods were used to excavate root systems with different groundwater levels; then, the aboveground biomass, root biomass, root spatial distribution, root topological structure and fractal characteristics of T. chinensis response characteristics to groundwater level were measured and analysed.
RESULTS: The results showed that with the decrease in the groundwater level, the soil water content and soil salt content showed upward trends. At high groundwater levels, T. chinensis reduced root biomass allocation to reduce the damage to roots caused by salinity. At low groundwater levels, T. chinensis strengthened the development of root systems, which greatly enhanced the ability of T. chinensis to balance its water intake. The root biomass at the high groundwater level was 43.06% lower than that at the low groundwater level. The relationship between root and shoot growth of T. chinensis at high groundwater levels and medium groundwater levels indicated allometric growth, and at low groundwater levels, roots and shoots grew uniformly. The root distribution of T. chinensis tended to be shallow at the different groundwater levels, showing the characteristics of a horizontal root type. At high groundwater levels, the root topological structure tended to be dichotomous, and the fractal dimension and fractal abundance values were both large, at 1.31 and 2.77, respectively. The branch complexity increased to achieve spatial expansion and increase plant stability. However, the topological structure of the medium and low groundwater level T. chinensis tended to be herringbone-like, the fractal dimension and fractal abundance values were small, the second branch was limited, and the structure was simple. The topological structure and fractal characteristics of the T. chinensis root system responded to different groundwater levels in a coordinated manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the differences in the growth and architecture of the T. chinensis root system, the T. chinensis root system has strong phenotypic plasticity to the heterogeneous water-salt habitat of the groundwater-soil system, and the T. chinensis root system shows strong root adaptability to water and salt stress.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.,"The research was financially supported by the Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U2006215), the Natural Science Foundation of Shangdong Province (ZR2020QD003), Open Research Fund Program of Shandong Key Laboratory of Eco-Environmental Science for Yellow River Delta (Binzhou University) (No. 2020KFJJ03), and Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province, China (TSQN201909152).",Marine Pollution Bulletin,,,Groundwater; Rivers; Soil; Tamaricaceae; Water,2022-05-10,2022,2022-05-10,2022-06,179,,113717,,,"Sun, Jia; Zhao, Ximei; Fang, Ying; Xu, Wenge; Gao, Fanglei; Zhao, Wanli; Fu, Qinqin; Xia, Jiangbao","Sun, Jia (Shandong Key Laboratory of Eco-Environmental Science for the Yellow River Delta, Binzhou University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, China; College of Forestry, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, Shandong 271018, China.); Zhao, Ximei (Shandong Key Laboratory of Eco-Environmental Science for the Yellow River Delta, Binzhou University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, China.); Fang, Ying (Shandong Key Laboratory of Eco-Environmental Science for the Yellow River Delta, Binzhou University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, China.); Xu, Wenge (Binzhou Hydrology Center, Binzhou, Shandong 256609, China.); Gao, Fanglei (Shandong Key Laboratory of Eco-Environmental Science for the Yellow River Delta, Binzhou University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, China.); Zhao, Wanli (Shandong Key Laboratory of Eco-Environmental Science for the Yellow River Delta, Binzhou University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, China.); Fu, Qinqin (Shandong Key Laboratory of Eco-Environmental Science for the Yellow River Delta, Binzhou University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, China.); Xia, Jiangbao (Shandong Key Laboratory of Eco-Environmental Science for the Yellow River Delta, Binzhou University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, China.

Objective: To investigate the association between retinal biomarkers from multimodal imaging (oculomics) and schizophrenia in a large real-world population.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional analysis used data from a retrospective cohort of 154 830 patients 40 years and older from the AlzEye study, which linked ophthalmic data with hospital admission data across England. Patients attended Moorfields Eye Hospital, a secondary care ophthalmic hospital with a principal central site, 4 district hubs, and 5 satellite clinics in and around London, United Kingdom, and had retinal imaging during the study period (January 2008 and April 2018). Data were analyzed from January 2022 to July 2022.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Retinovascular and optic nerve indices were computed from color fundus photography. Macular retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (mGC-IPL) thicknesses were extracted from optical coherence tomography. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between schizophrenia and retinal biomarkers.
Results: A total of 485 individuals (747 eyes) with schizophrenia (mean [SD] age, 64.9 years [12.2]; 258 [53.2%] female) and 100 931 individuals (165 400 eyes) without schizophrenia (mean age, 65.9 years [13.7]; 53 253 [52.8%] female) were included after images underwent quality control and potentially confounding conditions were excluded. Individuals with schizophrenia were more likely to have hypertension (407 [83.9%] vs 49 971 [48.0%]) and diabetes (364 [75.1%] vs 28 762 [27.6%]). The schizophrenia group had thinner mGC-IPL (-4.05 μm, 95% CI, -5.40 to -2.69; P = 5.4 × 10-9), which persisted when investigating only patients without diabetes (-3.99 μm; 95% CI, -6.67 to -1.30; P = .004) or just those 55 years and younger (-2.90 μm; 95% CI, -5.55 to -0.24; P = .03). On adjusted analysis, retinal fractal dimension among vascular variables was reduced in individuals with schizophrenia (-0.14 units; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.05; P = .001), although this was not present when excluding patients with diabetes.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, patients with schizophrenia had measurable differences in neural and vascular integrity of the retina. Differences in retinal vasculature were mostly secondary to the higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in patients with schizophrenia.

The surface morphology of these films influences their optical properties and therefore plays an important role in the overall efficiencies of the solar cells in which they are implemented. At rough surfaces light is diffusely scattered, extending the optical path of light inside the active layer of the solar cell, which in term improves light absorption and solar cell conversion efficiency. In this work, we investigated the surface morphology of undoped and doped SnO2 thin films and their influence on the optical properties of the films. We have compared and analysed the results obtained by several complementary methods for thin-film surface morphology investigation: atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS).

The focus of this study is on CLP triple helices whose strands are different lengths (i.e., heterotrimers), leading to dangling 'sticky ends'. These 'sticky ends' are segments of the CLP strands that have unbonded hydrogen-bonding donor/acceptor sites that drive heterotrimeric CLP triple helices to physically associate with one another, leading to assembly into higher-order structures. We use a validated CG model for CLP in implicit solvent and capture varying solvent quality through changing strength of attraction between CG beads representing the amino acids in the CLP strands. Our CG MD simulations show that, at lower CLP concentrations, CLP heterotrimers assemble into fibrils and, at higher CLP concentrations, into percolated networks. At higher concentrations, decreasing solvent quality causes (i) the formation of heterogeneous network structures with a lower degree of branching at network junctions and (ii) increases in the diameter of network strands and pore sizes. We also observe a nonmonotonic effect of solvent quality on distances between network junctions due to the balance between heterotrimer end-end associations driven by hydrogen bonding and side-side associations driven by worsening solvent quality. Below the percolation threshold, we observe that decreasing solvent quality leads to the formation of fibrils composed of multiple aligned CLP triple helices, while the number of 'sticky ends' governs the spatial extent (radius of gyration) of the assembled fibrils.","The computational work in this paper and the ongoing work on coarse grained CMP model dissemination via mosdef.org were financially supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) Grants CBET 1703402, CSSI 1835613, and DGE 2125703.

Phytochemicals such as indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and genistein (GEN) have chemoprotective effects on tumor cells. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the prostatic morphological aspects of rats exposed to BPA, GEN, and I3C during the perinatal period and submitted to hormonal stimulus in adulthood. Blood was collected to obtain hormone concentrations. Slides stained with hematoxylin & eosin, and picrosirius were subjected to fractal, stereological, morphometric, and collagen quantification analysis. I3C decreased the plasma dihydrotestosterone levels, and both phytochemicals increased the plasma estrogen levels. Unlike phytochemicals, BPA did not alter any of the parameters evaluated. GEN reduced the epithelial height, while I3C increased the fractal dimension and stromal collagen. Although BPA did not alter the prostate morphology, the phytochemicals provided beneficial effects for the prostate histological organization in adult animals subjected to hormonal stimulus.",,"This work was supported by a grant from the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo - FAPESP (Grants Numbers: 2012/24935-6, 2019/14081-9).",International Journal of Environmental Health Research,,,Male; Pregnancy; Female; Rats; Animals; Prostate; Estrogens; Genistein; Benzhydryl Compounds; Phytochemicals; Collagen; Phenols,2022-11,2022,2022-11,2024-01-02,34,1,201-212,,,"Sousa, Thainá Cavalleri; de Oliveira, Camila Bonillo; Ricardo, Maria Luiza Silva; de Aquino, Ariana Musa; Scarano, Wellerson Rodrigo; Veras, Allice Santos Cruz; Tavares, Maria Eduarda Almeida; Teixeira, Giovana Rampazzo; Castillho, Anthony César deSousa; Pacagnelli, Francis Lopes; Brandt, Joyce Zalotti; de Oliveira Mendes, Leonardo","Sousa, Thainá Cavalleri (Graduate Program in Animal Science, Western São Paulo University (UNOESTE), Presidente Prudente, Brazil); de Oliveira, Camila Bonillo (Graduate Program in Animal Science, Western São Paulo University (UNOESTE), Presidente Prudente, Brazil); Ricardo, Maria Luiza Silva (Graduate Program in Animal Science, Western São Paulo University (UNOESTE), Presidente Prudente, Brazil); de Aquino, Ariana Musa (Department of Functional and Structural Biology, IBB/UNESP, Botucatu, Brazil); Scarano, Wellerson Rodrigo (Department of Functional and Structural Biology, IBB/UNESP, Botucatu, Brazil); Veras, Allice Santos Cruz (Experimental Laboratory of Exercise Biology (LEBioEx), São Paulo State University (UNESP), Presidente Prudente, Brazil); Tavares, Maria Eduarda Almeida (Experimental Laboratory of Exercise Biology (LEBioEx), São Paulo State University (UNESP), Presidente Prudente, Brazil); Teixeira, Giovana Rampazzo (Experimental Laboratory of Exercise Biology (LEBioEx), São Paulo State University (UNESP), Presidente Prudente, Brazil); Castillho, Anthony César deSousa (Graduate Program in Animal Science, Western São Paulo University (UNOESTE), Presidente Prudente, Brazil); Pacagnelli, Francis Lopes (Graduate Program in Animal Science, Western São Paulo University (UNOESTE), Presidente Prudente, Brazil); Brandt, Joyce Zalotti (Department of Nutrition, Unimed Hospital, Botucatu, Brazil); de Oliveira Mendes, Leonardo (Graduate Program in Animal Science, Western São Paulo University (UNOESTE), Presidente Prudente, Brazil; Master Program in Health Science, Western São Paulo University (UNOESTE), Presidente Prudente, Brazil)","de Oliveira Mendes, Leonardo (Universidade do Oeste Paulista; Universidade do Oeste Paulista)","Sousa, Thainá Cavalleri (Universidade do Oeste Paulista); de Oliveira, Camila Bonillo (Universidade do Oeste Paulista); Ricardo, Maria Luiza Silva (Universidade do Oeste Paulista); de Aquino, Ariana Musa (Department of Functional and Structural Biology, IBB/UNESP, Botucatu, Brazil); Scarano, Wellerson Rodrigo (Department of Functional and Structural Biology, IBB/UNESP, Botucatu, Brazil); Veras, Allice Santos Cruz (São Paulo State University); Tavares, Maria Eduarda Almeida (São Paulo State University); Teixeira, Giovana Rampazzo (São Paulo State University); Castillho, Anthony César deSousa (Universidade do Oeste Paulista); Pacagnelli, Francis Lopes (Universidade do Oeste Paulista); Brandt, Joyce Zalotti (Department of Nutrition, Unimed Hospital, Botucatu, Brazil); de Oliveira Mendes, Leonardo (Universidade do Oeste Paulista; Universidade do Oeste Paulista)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152410769,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations; 40 Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering; 42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology",

Atrophy is the structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hallmark of neurodegeneration. However in most cases it likely indicates a relatively advanced stage of disease less susceptible to treatment as some disease processes begin decades prior to clinical onset. Among emerging metrics that characterise brain shape rather than volume, fractal dimension (FD) quantifies shape complexity. FD has been applied in diverse fields of science to measure subtle changes in elaborate structures. We review its application thus far to structural MRI of the brain in neurodegenerative disease and dementia. We identified studies involving subjects who met criteria for mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's Disease, Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, Frontotemporal Dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Multiple Systems Atrophy, Spinocerebellar Ataxia and Multiple Sclerosis. The early literature suggests that neurodegenerative disease processes are usually associated with a decline in FD of the brain. The literature includes examples of disease-related change in FD occurring independently of atrophy, which if substantiated would represent a valuable advantage over other structural imaging metrics. However, it is likely to be non-specific and to exhibit complex spatial and temporal patterns. A more harmonious methodological approach across a larger number of studies as well as careful attention to technical factors associated with image processing and FD measurement will help to better elucidate the metric's utility.",JOB is supported by Cambridge NIHR Biomedical centre and the Cambridge Centre for Parkinson’s Plus.

Understanding the role of microvascular flow distributions across conditions is of interest to investigators spanning multiple disciplines; however, data collection within networks can be labor-intensive and challenging due to limited resolution. To overcome these experimental challenges, computational network models that can accurately simulate vascular behavior are highly beneficial. Constrained constructive optimization (CCO) is a commonly used algorithm for vascular simulation, particularly well known for its adaptability toward vascular modeling across tissues. The present work demonstrates an implementation of CCO aimed to simulate a branching arteriolar microvasculature in healthy skeletal muscle, validated against literature including comprehensive rat gluteus maximus vasculature datasets, and reviews a list of user-specified adjustable model parameters to understand how their variability affects the simulated networks. Network geometric properties, including mean element diameters, lengths, and numbers of bifurcations per order, Horton's law ratios, and fractal dimension, demonstrate good validation once model parameters are adjusted to experimental data. This model successfully demonstrates hemodynamic properties such as Murray's law and the network Fahraeus effect. Application of centrifugal and Strahler ordering schemes results in divergent descriptions of identical simulated networks. This work introduces a novel CCO-based model focused on generating branching skeletal muscle microvascular arteriolar networks based on adjustable model parameters, thus making it a valuable tool for investigations into skeletal muscle microvascular structure and tissue perfusion.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present work introduces a CCO-based algorithm for generating branching arteriolar networks, with adjustable model parameters to enable modeling in varying skeletal muscle tissues. The geometric and hemodynamic parameters of the generated networks have been comprehensively validated using experimental data collected previously in-house and from literature. This is one of few validated CCO-based models to specialize in skeletal muscle microvasculature and acts as a beneficial tool for investigating the microvasculature for hypothesis testing and validation.",,,Journal of Applied Physiology,,,"Animals; Muscle, Skeletal; Rats; Arterioles; Algorithms; Models, Cardiovascular; Computer Simulation; Microcirculation; Hemodynamics; Microvessels",2024-04-11,2024,2024-04-11,2024-06-01,136,6,1303-1321,,,"Bao, Yuki; Frisbee, Amelia C; Frisbee, Jefferson C; Goldman, Daniel","Bao, Yuki (Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.); Frisbee, Amelia C (Department of Physics, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.); Frisbee, Jefferson C (Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.); Goldman, Daniel (Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.)","Goldman, Daniel (Western University)","Bao, Yuki (Western University); Frisbee, Amelia C (University of Guelph); Frisbee, Jefferson C (Western University); Goldman, Daniel (Western University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170620619,31 Biological Sciences; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,

As a result, electrooculogram (EOG) signals may also differ between the two groups. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the recorded EOG signals of 30 ADHD children and 30 healthy children (control group) while performing an attention-related task.
Methods: Two features of approximate entropy (ApEn) and Petrosian's fractal dimension (Pet's FD) of EOG signals were calculated for the two groups. Then, the two groups were classified using the vector derived from two features and two support vector machine (SVM) and neural gas (NG) classifiers.
Results: Statistical analysis showed that the values of both features were significantly lower in the ADHD group compared to the control group. Moreover, the SVM classifier (accuracy: 84.6% ± 4.4%, sensitivity: 85.2% ± 4.9%, specificity: 78.8% ± 6.5%) was more successful in separating the two groups than the NG (78.1% ± 1.1%, sensitivity: 80.1% ± 6.2%, specificity: 72.2% ± 9.2%).
Conclusion: The decrease in ApEn and Pet's FD values in the EOG signals of the ADHD group showed that their eye movements were slower than the control group and this difference was due to their attention deficit. The results of this study can be used to design an EOG biofeedback training course to reduce the symptoms of ADHD patients.","We, hereby, express our sincere thanks to Prof. Ali Motie Nasrabadi for providing the database.",,Journal of Medical Signals & Sensors,,,,2022-07-26,2022,2022-07-26,2022,12,3,254-262,,,"Sho’ouri, Nasrin","Sho’ouri, Nasrin (Faculty of Technology and Engineering, Central Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran)","Sho’ouri, Nasrin (Islamic Azad University, Tehran)","Sho’ouri, Nasrin (Islamic Azad University, Tehran)",5,5,0.42,1.82,https://doi.org/10.4103/jmss.jmss_119_21,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150523135,40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering,

Improved prediction of dementia is an important goal in developing future prevention strategies. Diabetic retinopathy screening (DRS) photographs may be a convenient source of imaging biomarkers of brain health. We therefore investigated the association of retinal vascular measures (RVMs) from DRS photographs in patients with type 2 diabetes with dementia risk.
Research Design and Methods: RVMs were obtained from 6,111 patients in the GoDARTS bioresource (635 incident cases) using VAMPIRE software. Their association, independent of Apo E4 genotype and clinical parameters, was determined for incident all cause dementia (ACD) and separately Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD). We used Cox's proportional hazards with competing risk of death without dementia. The potential value of RVMs to increase the accuracy of risk prediction was evaluated.
Results: Increased retinal arteriolar fractal dimension associated with increased risk of ACD (csHR 1.17; 1.08-1.26) and AD (HR 1.33; 1.16-1.52), whereas increased venular fractal dimension (FDV) was associated with reduced risk of AD (csHR 0.85; 0.74-0.96). Conversely, FDV was associated with increased risk of VD (csHR 1.22; 1.07-1.40). Wider arteriolar calibre was associated with a reduced risk of ACD (csHR 0.9; 0.83-0.98) and wider venular calibre was associated with a reduced risk of AD (csHR 0.87; 0.78-0.97). Accounting for competing risk did not substantially alter these findings. RVMs significantly increased the accuracy of prediction.
Conclusions: Conventional DRS photographs could enhance stratifying patients with diabetes at increased risk of dementia facilitating the development of future prevention strategies.",The authors acknowledge all the GoDARTS participants and all personnel at the University of Dundee who have assisted in the development and maintenance of the GoDARTS bioresource.

It is known that osteoporotic changes can occur secondary to steroid usage, depending on dosage and duration. The aim of this study was to compare radiomorphometric indices and fractal dimension on panoramic images of patients with asthma using ICSs and healthy controls.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 66 dental panoramic radiographs (DPRs) taken from 32 patients with asthma using ICSs and 34 healthy individuals were evaluated in this retrospective study. Panoramic mandibular index inferior and superior (PMI-i,PMI-s), mandibular cortical width (MCW), gonial index (GI), antegonial index (AI), mandibular cortical index (MCI), and fractal dimension analysis (FDA) were measured on DPRs.
RESULTS: PMI-s (p=0.02), MCW (p<0.001), GI (p<0.001) and AI (p<0.001) values were significantly lower in the group of the asthma using ICSs than control group. However, the PMI-i (p ˃0.05) measurement, the MCI (p ˃0.05) and FDA values distribution were similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of ICSs in asthma patients can affect bone quality. The evaluation of PMI-s, MCW, GI, and AI on DPR can help determine the effect of this drug on the jawbones in the early period and select dental and surgical treatment plans appropriately.","Authors contributions All authors of this research manuscript have directly participated in the planning, execution, analysis and/or writing of the study.

The relation between rock type difference and pore structure difference is explored, and the controlling effect of pore-throat structure on physical properties of fine-grained sandstone reservoir is studied. The results show that the sandstone sample can be categorized into quartz arenites, sublitharenite, and lithic sandstone. The average porosity and permeability are, respectively, 4.46% and 0.129 mD. The pores are mainly of intergranular and intercrystalline types, and the throats are lamellar and tubular types. Furthermore, the fine-grained sandstone is typically characterized by a binary pore structure. Micropore-throat, as the main reservoir space, is the dominant factor of the reservoir physical property difference. In addition, the correlation between fractal dimension and rock composition is studied with pore-throat morphology being comprehensively analyzed. The results indicate that the quartz arenite is dominated by quartz intergranular lamellar throats, and there are numerous intergranular pores and tubular throats connecting them in litharenite and sublitharenite. Moreover, the content of pores and throats play major roles in the change of fractal dimension. The characteristics, causes, and main controlling factors of micropore and throat types should be emphatically analyzed to predict the physical properties of fine-grained sandstone.","This work was founded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41772130), the Postgraduate Research &amp; Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (KYCX22_2602), and the Graduate Innovation Program of China University of Mining and Technology (2022WLKXJ035).

TEMPO oxidation, as the most common surface modification, can greatly improve the dispersion and re-dispersion of CNFs. However, the diameter of TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNFs) has not been regulated in most researches, which was an important factor determining the dispersion and re-dispersion of TOCNFs. Herein, this work explored the effect of carboxyl groups on dispersion and re-dispersion of TOCNFs with uniform diameter in various solvents. Notably, fractal dimension was innovatively introduced to characterize the distribution of TOCNFs diameter. The fractal dimension and statistic diameter of TCONFs with different carboxyl group contents are ~1.56 and ~22 nm, demonstrating that the diameter of TOCNFs has been regulated in the same range. When the carboxyl group content is up to 1.58 mmol/g, the dispersion and re-dispersion of TOCNFs suspension in water and different organic solvents are the most uniform and stable. In a word, this work explores the dispersion and re-dispersion of TOCNFs with the uniform diameter and different carboxyl group contents, which can provide the theoretical guidance for various potential applications of nanofibrils in polymer matrix composites.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31870565), and Postgraduate Research Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (KYCX21_0884).",,International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,,,"Cellulose; Cellulose, Oxidized; Nanofibers; Polymers; Solvents; Suspensions",2022-03-04,2022,2022-03-04,2022-05,207,,23-30,,,"Zai, Zhenqiang; Yan, Ming; Shi, Chun; Zhang, Lili; Lu, Hailong; Xiong, Zhixin; Ma, Jinxia","Zai, Zhenqiang (Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center of Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources, Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab of Pulp and Paper Science and Technology, College of Light Industry and Food, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.); Yan, Ming (Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center of Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources, Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab of Pulp and Paper Science and Technology, College of Light Industry and Food, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.); Shi, Chun (Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center of Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources, Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab of Pulp and Paper Science and Technology, College of Light Industry and Food, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.); Zhang, Lili (Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center of Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources, Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab of Pulp and Paper Science and Technology, College of Light Industry and Food, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.); Lu, Hailong (Institute of Chemical Industry of Forest Products, Chinese Academy of Forestry, National Engineering Lab for Biomass Chemical Utilization, Key and Open Lab of Forest Chemical Engineering of State Administration of Forestry and Grassland, Key Lab of Biomass Energy and Material of Jiangsu Province, No. 16 Suojinwucun Road, Xuanwu District, Nanjing 210042, China.); Xiong, Zhixin (Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center of Efficient Processing and Utilization of Forest Resources, Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab of Pulp and Paper Science and Technology, College of Light Industry and Food, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.

This non-invasive, safe, and painless screening tool can reduce the mortality due to cancer by early detection and monitoring. This prospective study aims to analyze changes in static breast thermograms of a BIRADS V category breast cancer patient to assess the response to Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in locally advanced cancer and to compare with thermograms of a BIRADS II category benign patient. Breast thermograms of the malignant and benign patients in five different views were taken using FLIR E40 thermal camera under strict acquisition protocols. Details of the patient along with the thermograms were recorded pre and post NACT. There is a qualitative reduction in the warm region of the surface after the first cycle of chemotherapy treatment. Thermal, fractal, and statistical analysis of thermograms is performed for both patients. In the patient with aggressive ductal carcinoma, the difference in the mean surface temperature between contralateral breasts is high, which is reduced after the first cycle of NACT. This preliminary study indicates that breast thermography can potentially be used as an effective non-invasive, non-contact, and radiation-free tool to analyze the effect of NACT on patients with different stages of breast cancer. This study also signifies the role of the thermography technique in reaching a largely rural population with limited medical resources for early cancer screening.","The authors wish to thank the female patient who gave consent for this study.

Based on Weibull statistical damage distribution theory, the dynamic constitutive model of GC after water saturation was constructed. The results show that the dynamic peak strain and specific energy absorption of GC have strain rate strengthening effect before or after water saturation. The impact toughness of GC decreases after water saturation. The size distribution of GC fragments has fractal characteristics, and the fractal dimension of GC fragments after water saturation is smaller than that before water saturation.

To demonstrate this effect, we developed two mathematical models that describe the fractal nature of the expression of seven key genes in the embryonic breast and thigh muscles in eight breeds of meat, dual purpose, egg and game types. In the first model, we produced breed-specific coefficients of gene expression conformity in each muscle type using the slopes of regression dependencies, as well as an integral myogenesis gene expression index (MGEI). Additionally, breed fractal dimensions and integral myogenesis gene expression fractal dimension index (MGEFDI) were determined. The second gene expression model was based on plotting fractal portraits and calculating indices of fractal bioconsolidation. The bioconsolidation index of myogenesis gene expression correlated with the chick growth rate and nitric oxide (NO) oxidation rate. The proposed fractal models were instrumental in interpreting the genetic diversity of chickens at the level of gene expression for early myogenesis, NO metabolism and the postnatal growth of chicks.",We thank all the research assistants who contributed to this work.,This study performed at the FSBEI HE “Moscow State Academy of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology–MVA named after K.

This study analyzes the phenomena involved in the water recovery stage, such as sedimentation of clay-based tailings flocculated with anionic polyelectrolyte in industrial water and seawater. Flocculation-sedimentation batch tests were performed to ascertain the aggregate size distribution, the hindered settling rate, and the structure of flocs expressed through their fractal dimension and density. The aggregates' properties were characterized by the Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM) and Particle Vision Microscope (PVM) techniques. The impact of the type of water depends on the type of clay that constitutes the suspension. For quartz/kaolin, the highest performance was obtained in industrial water, with bigger aggregates and faster settling rates. However, the tailings composed of quartz/Na-montmorillonite reversed this trend. The type of water impacted the efficiency of primary-particle aggregation. The trials in industrial water generated a portion of non-flocculated particles, which was observed through a bimodal distribution in the unweighted chord-length distribution. This behavior was not observed in seawater, where a perceptible fraction of non-flocculated particles was not found. The additional cationic bonds that offer seawater favor finer primary-particle agglomeration for all tailings types.",Steven Nieto acknowledges the National Agency for Research and Development (ANID)/National doctorate scholarship (DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2020-21200985) and the infrastructure and support of the Programa de Doctorado en Ingeniería de Procesos de Minerales of the Universidad de Antofagasta.

To study the variation in coal pores depending on stress, first, a mechanical analysis was carried out, and then the characteristics of coal samples before and after triaxial compression were quantitatively analyzed combined with low-temperature nitrogen adsorption experiments. The compressive strength of the coal samples with a high elastic modulus is significantly greater than that of coal samples with a low elastic modulus. Sihe coal samples with a larger elastic modulus experienced higher peak stress and strain during compression than those from the Chengzhuang Mine with a smaller elastic modulus. With the exception of the coal sample from the Chengzhuang Mine with a confining pressure of 15 MPa, the peak strength and axial strain of the coal samples gradually increased with an increase in confining pressure. The larger the elastic modulus, the greater the axial strain. After triaxial compression, pores with diameters ranging from 2 to 5 nm exhibited a significant change. After the compression of coal with a high elastic modulus, the pore volume and pore specific surface area decreased with the increase in confining pressure, by 60.7 and 59.7%, respectively (compared with raw coal). The complex pore structure consisting of mesopores and macropores (>11 nm) became simpler. The volume and specific surface area of the pores of the coal samples with a low elastic modulus first increased, then decreased, and then increased again with the increase in confining pressure, and after compression, the roughness and complexity of macropores of coal samples are greater than those of micropores. The changes induced in the coal samples of the two mining areas in response to compression differ, which are related to the mechanical properties of the coal bodies.","This study was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42072195), the Bidding Project of Shanxi Science and Technology Plan (20201101001), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Universities of Henan Province (NSFRF180103).",,ACS Omega,,,,2022-05-05,2022,2022-05-05,2022-05-17,7,19,16728-16739,,,"He, Haixia; Wang, Kai; Pan, Jienan; Wang, Xianglong; Wang, Zhenzhi","He, Haixia (School of Resources & Environment, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454000, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Coalbed Methane and Shale Gas for Central Plains Economic Region, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China); Wang, Kai (School of Resources & Environment, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454000, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Coalbed Methane and Shale Gas for Central Plains Economic Region, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China); Pan, Jienan (School of Resources & Environment, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454000, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Coalbed Methane and Shale Gas for Central Plains Economic Region, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China); Wang, Xianglong (School of Resources & Environment, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454000, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Coalbed Methane and Shale Gas for Central Plains Economic Region, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China); Wang, Zhenzhi (School of Resources & Environment, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, 454000, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Coalbed Methane and Shale Gas for Central Plains Economic Region, Jiaozuo, 454000, Henan, China)","Pan, Jienan (Henan Polytechnic University; Henan Polytechnic University)","He, Haixia (Henan Polytechnic University; Henan Polytechnic University); Wang, Kai (Henan Polytechnic University; Henan Polytechnic University); Pan, Jienan (Henan Polytechnic University; Henan Polytechnic University); Wang, Xianglong (Henan Polytechnic University; Henan Polytechnic University); Wang, Zhenzhi (Henan Polytechnic University; Henan Polytechnic University)",3,3,,1.38,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c01269,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147659435,34 Chemical Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

However, a structural magnetic resonance imaging analysis using a surface-based morphology method to identify regions with cortical features abnormalities at the vertex-based level has not yet been performed. Methods: Fifteen participants with CA and 13 healthy controls underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. A surface-based morphology method was used to identify anatomical abnormalities. Then, the surface parameters' mean value of the identified clusters with statistically significant between-group differences were extracted and compared. Finally, Pearson's correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation between the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) scores and surface parameters. Results: The CA group had significantly lower MBEA scores than the healthy controls (p = 0.000). The CA group exhibited a significant higher fractal dimension in the right caudal middle frontal gyrus and a lower sulcal depth in the right pars triangularis gyrus (p < 0.05; false discovery rate-corrected at the cluster level) compared to healthy controls. There were negative correlations between the mean fractal dimension values in the right caudal middle frontal gyrus and MBEA score, including the mean MBEA score (r = -0.5398, p = 0.0030), scale score (r = -0.5712, p = 0.0015), contour score (r = -0.4662, p = 0.0124), interval score (r = -0.4564, p = 0.0146), rhythmic score (r = -0.5133, p = 0.0052), meter score (r = -0.3937, p = 0.0382), and memory score (r = -0.3879, p = 0.0414). There was a significant positive correlation between the mean sulcal depth in the right pars triangularis gyrus and the MBEA score, including the mean score (r = 0.5130, p = 0.0052), scale score (r = 0.5328, p = 0.0035), interval score (r = 0.4059, p = 0.0321), rhythmic score (r = 0.5733, p = 0.0014), meter score (r = 0.5061, p = 0.0060), and memory score (r = 0.4001, p = 0.0349). Conclusion: Individuals with CA exhibit cortical morphological changes in the right hemisphere. These findings may indicate that the neural basis of speech perception and memory impairments in individuals with CA is associated with abnormalities in the right pars triangularis gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, and that these cortical abnormalities may be a neural marker of CA.",We wish to thank all participants for their effort and time spent participating in this study.

Detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs), 3-5 nm diamond nanoparticles synthesized through detonation process, have attracted great interest for drug delivery due to their colloidal stability in water and their biocompatibility. More recent studies have challenged the consensus that DNDs are monodispersed after their fabrication, with their aggregate formation poorly understood. Here, we present a novel characterization method of combining machine learning with direct cryo-transmission electron microscopy imaging to characterize the unique colloidal behavior of DNDs. Together with small-angle X-ray scattering and mesoscale simulations we show and explain the clear differences in the aggregation behavior between positively and negatively charged DNDs. Our new method can be applied to other complex particle systems, which builds essential knowledge for the safe implementation of nanoparticles in drug delivery.","S.L.Y.C. and I.C.K. acknowledge the use of TEMs at the Electron Microscope Unit, Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre, UNSW.

Biochar is frequently applied to soils to improve the macropore structure, but the effects remain controversial. To clarify depth-dependent soil macropore characteristics affected by biochar addition, the intact soil cores with a depth of 200 mm were collected from biochar-amended paddy field at addition rates of 0, 24, and 48 t ha-1 (CK, BC1, and BC2, respectively). The two biochar treatments did not change the overall soil pore indices (e.g., macroporosity, pore number, fractal dimension, and circularity), but showed distinct effects at different soil depths. At a soil depth of 0-50 mm, the biochar treatments had higher macroporosity (8.59-8.85 %) than CK (4.94 %) (p < 0.05), but relatively lower pore circularity (0.83-0.84) than CK (0.88) (p < 0.05). The connectivity of biochar treatments (88-97) was 9.5-10.4 times higher than that of CK (9.3). At a soil depth of 100-200 mm, the biochar treatments exhibited lower macroporosity, macropore number, connectivity, and fractal dimension than CK (p < 0.05). The macropore indices (except circularity) of BC1 were relatively higher than those of BC2 in the most soil depths. Whether biochar altered the soil macropore indices depended on the addition rate of biochar and soil depth. The expansion and occupying effects of biochar were dominant at soil depths of 0-50 and 100-200 mm, respectively; and the two effects were stronger in BC1 than in BC2. A combination of the expansion and occupying effects occurred at a soil depth of 50-100 mm. The distinct effects of biochar on soil pore structure at different depths could mitigate methane emission and nutrient runoff loss from the double-rice paddy. Therefore, soil depth-dependent macropore structure should be considered when assessing the influence of biochar on soil properties and the associated environmental effects.","The present study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42177296), the Key Research Project of Frontier Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (QYZDJ-SSW-DQC041), and the Open Fund of the Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISA2020201).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Soil; Oryza; Charcoal; Soil Microbiology,2022-10-10,2022,2022-10-10,2023-01,857,Pt 1,159368,,,"Wang, Liufang; Luo, Pei; Jiang, Chunyu; Shen, Jianlin; Liu, Feng; Xiao, Runlin; Wu, Jinshui","Wang, Liufang (Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Regions, Changsha Research Station for Agricultural & Environmental Monitoring, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha 410125, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.); Luo, Pei (Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Regions, Changsha Research Station for Agricultural & Environmental Monitoring, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha 410125, China.

We also develop a graphical test based on the log–log plot to calculate the box-counting dimension.

This study aims to explore an effective and efficient modeling method for biomimetic porous bone scaffolds for biological three-dimensional printing based on the imitation of the histomorphological characteristics of human vertebral cancellous bone. The fluid mass transport and mechanical characteristics of the porous scaffolds were evaluated and compared with those of a human cancellous bone,and the relationship between the geometric parameters (e.g., the size, number, shape of pores and porosity) and the performence of biomimetic porous bone scaffolds are revealed.
METHODS: The bionic modeling design method proposed in this study considers the biological characteristics of vertebral cancellous tissue and performs imitation and design of vertebrae-like two-dimensional slices images.It then reconstructs the slices layer-by-layer to form porous scaffolds with a three-dimensional reconstruction method, similar to computed tomography image reconstruction. By controlling the design parameters, this method can easily realize the formation of plate-like (femoral cancellous bone-like) or rod-like (vertebral cancellous bone-like) porous scaffolds. The flow characterization of porous structures was performed using the computational fluid simulation method.
RESULTS: The flow characterization results showed that the permeability of the porous scaffolds and human bone was 10-8∼10-9m2,and when the porosity of the porous scaffolds was higher than 70%, the permeability was higher than that of human vertebrae with a porosity of 82%. The maximum shear stress of the designed porous scaffolds and human vertebra were less than 0.8Mpa, which was conducive to cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell differentiation. The results of 3D printing and mechanical testing showed good printability and reflected the relationship between the mechanical properties and design parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: The design method proposed in this study has many controllable parameters, which can be adjusted to generate diversified functional porous structures to meet specific needs, increase the potential of bone scaffold design, and leave room for meeting the new requirements for bone scaffold characteristics in the future.","This project is sponsored by the National Key Research and Development Program of China(Grant No. 2019QY(Y)0502), the key research and development program of Shaanxi province(Grant No. 2020ZDLSF04-07), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51905438), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 31020190502009), the Innovation Platform of Biofabrication (Grant No.17SF0002), the Science and Technology Program of Xi&#x27;an(Grant No. 21ZCZZHXJS-QCY6-0014) and the Project Based Personnel Exchange Program with China Scholarship Council and German Academic Exchange Service(PPP)(NO.201709920023).",,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,,"Bionics; Bone and Bones; Humans; Porosity; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds",2022-08-06,2022,2022-08-06,2022-10,225,,107059,,,"Li, Xinpei; Wang, Yanen; Zhang, Bo; Yang, Haozhe; Mushtaq, Ray Tahir; Liu, Minyan; Bao, Chengwei; Shi, Yikai; Luo, Zhuojing; Zhang, Weihong","Li, Xinpei (Industry Engineering Department, School of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 West Youyi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710072, PR China.); Wang, Yanen (Industry Engineering Department, School of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, 127 West Youyi Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710072, PR China.

In 563 patients with vascular disease (58 ± 10 years), we examined the relationship between WMH volume, shape, and cognitive functioning. WMH volume and shape were automatically determined on 1.5T brain MRI data. Standardized linear regression analyses estimated the association between WMH volume and shape (concavity index, solidity, convexity, fractal dimension, and eccentricity) and memory and executive functioning, adjusted for age, sex, educational level, and reading ability. Larger WMH volumes were associated with lower executive functioning Z-scores (b (95%-CI): -0.09 (-0.17;-0.01)). Increased shape complexity of periventricular/confluent WMH associated with lower executive functioning (concavity index +1SD: -0.13 (-0.20;-0.06); solidity -1SD: -0.09 (-0.17;-0.02)) and lower memory function (fractal dimension +1SD: -0.10 (-0.18;-0.02)).

It is shown that a set of fractals, whose sizes are distributed according to a power law, can change its fractal dimension when the power-law exponent is sufficiently big. As a result, the scattering exponent corresponding to this dimension appears due to the spatial correlations between positions of different fractals. For large values of the momentum transfer, the correlations do not play any role, and the resulting scattering intensity is given by a sum of intensities of all composing fractals. The restrictions imposed on the power-law exponents are found.

In this paper, the characteristics of the macroscopic compressive strength, microscopic interface bending, porosity, and fractal dimension of the consolidated body were studied, and the structure strength relationship between loading rates, porosity, fractal dimension, and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) was established. The results show that the loading rates had a great and consistent effect on the macro- and micro-mechanical properties of the consolidated body. Macroscopically, in the range of 0.1~0.4 mm/min, the UCS and elastic modulus of the solidified body increased with the increase in the loading rate, and there was a critical loading rate (η = 0.4 mm/min). At the microscale, with the increase in loading rates, the interface bending phenomenon, porosity, fractal dimension, and UCS of the grout and coal were consistent, showing a trend of increasing first and then decreasing.

In this study, the mechanical mechanism of glaze cracking is studied, based on the statistical strength theory, damage mechanics, and continuum mechanics. Furthermore, the influence of the glaze layer thickness, heat transfer coefficient, expansion coefficient, and temperature difference on the creation and propagation of inner microcracks is systematically investigated, and the final discrete fracture network of ceramics is discussed at the specific crack saturation state. The results show that (1) a higher heat transfer coefficient will lead to a more uniform distribution of the surface temperature and a faster cooling process of the ceramics, reducing the number of microcracks when the ambient temperature is reached; (2) the thinner glaze layer is less prone to cracking when its thickness is smaller than that of the blank. However, when the thickness of the glaze layer is similar to that of the blank, the increased thickness of the glaze layer will increase the number of cracks on its surface; and (3) when the expansion coefficient of the glaze layer is smaller than that of the blank, cracks will not occur inside the glaze layer. However, as the coefficient of the thermal expansion of the glaze layer continuously rises, the number of cracks on its surface will first increase and then decrease.",,This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42050201).,Materials,,,,2023-08-08,2023,2023-08-08,,16,16,5508,,,"Chen, Tiantian; Gong, Bin; Tang, Chun’an","Chen, Tiantian (School of Resources and Civil Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China;, chentiantian0304@163.com); Gong, Bin (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Brunel University London, London UB8 3PH, UK); Tang, Chun’an (State Key Laboratory of Coastal and Offshore Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024, China;, tca@mail.neu.edu.cn)","Gong, Bin (Brunel University London)","Chen, Tiantian (Northeastern University); Gong, Bin (Brunel University London); Tang, Chun’an (Dalian University of Technology)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/16/5508/pdf?version=1691474750,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163139404,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,

Current clinical risk stratification criteria are inadequate in identifying patients who are at risk for VA and in need of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a risk prediction approach based on imaging biomarkers from the combination of late gadolinium contrast-enhanced (LGE) MRI and T1 mapping. We then aimed to compare the prediction to a virtual heart computational risk assessment approach based on LGE-T1 virtual heart models.
METHODS: The methodology involved combining short-axis LGE-MRI with post-contrast T1 maps to define personalized thresholds for diffuse and dense fibrosis. The combined LGE-T1 maps were used to evaluate imaging biomarkers for VA risk prediction. The risk prediction capability of the biomarkers was compared with that of the LGE-T1 virtual heart arrhythmia inducibility simulation. VA risk prediction performance from both approaches was compared to clinical outcome (presence of clinical VA).
RESULTS: Image-based biomarkers, including hypertrophy, signal intensity heterogeneity, and fibrotic border complexity, could not discriminate high vs low VA risk. LGE-T1 virtual heart technology outperformed all the image-based biomarker metrics and was statistically significant in predicting VA risk in HCM.
CONCLUSIONS: We combined two MR imaging techniques to analyze imaging biomarkers in HCM. Raw and processed image-based biomarkers cannot discriminate patients with VA from those without VA. Hybrid LGE-T1 virtual heart models could correctly predict VA risk for this cohort and may improve SCD risk stratification to better identify HCM patients for primary preventative ICD implantation.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors have no conflicts to disclose.,"NIH Grant R01HL142496 to NAT, NSF DGE-1746891 to RPO",Journal of Electrocardiology,,,"Humans; Electrocardiography; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Technology",2022-09-17,2022,2022-09-17,2022-09,74,,122-127,,,"O'Hara, Ryan P; Prakosa, Adityo; Binka, Edem; Lacy, Audrey; Trayanova, Natalia A","O'Hara, Ryan P (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, United States of America.); Prakosa, Adityo (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, United States of America.); Binka, Edem (Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States of America.); Lacy, Audrey (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, United States of America.); Trayanova, Natalia A (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, United States of America.

STUDY DESIGN: We divided a sample of 105 patients with skeletal class I occlusion, cervical vertebral maturation CS6, and skeletal vertical dimension ratios within normal limits into right asymmetric, left asymmetric, and symmetric groups. We performed FA on 6 bilateral regions of interest on panoramic radiographs of the patients and calculated the mean fractal dimension (FD) for each region. We performed the Wilcoxon signed-rank and paired t tests to compare the significance of differences in FD between sides within each group and between groups for all regions. Statistical significance was established at P < .05.
RESULTS: We found statistically significant differences in mean FD values between the right and left condyles of the 2 asymmetric patient groups. The FD was greater in the left condyle of patients with right asymmetry and in the right condyle of patients with left asymmetry. The right condyle had a significantly greater FD in left asymmetric patients than in right asymmetric patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of FA indicate that asymmetry is characterized by an increase in the mean FD of the condyle that is responsible for the asymmetry.

In this study, the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) was used to test the dynamic properties of rock samples by loading four different pressures (0.05, 0.08, 0.14, and 0.23 MPa). The peak stress of the sample increases from 82.19 to 284.16 MPa, and the particle size of the sample debris decreases from 46.57 to 18.34 mm as the impact pressure increases from 0.05 to 0.23 MPa. As a chaos method in nonlinear dynamics, it is introduced into the quantitative evaluation of the sample at four loading pressures, which is then calculated. The damage evolution process of the sample under four loading pressures is calculated, and the chaotic characteristics contained in the process are analyzed. Based on the logistic mapping, the increase in the load velocity can delay the entry of the damage variable into the period-doubling bifurcation and chaotic states. Finally, the fractal dimension of the rock crack at the corresponding time under different load speeds is calculated, and the results showed that the increase in the load velocity can increase the uniformity of the crack distribution.",,This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Fund (grant no. 52108448).,Materials,,,,2022-11-08,2022,2022-11-08,,15,22,7890,,,"Wu, Nan; Fu, Jiyang; Xiong, Chao","Wu, Nan (Reserch Center for Wind Engineering and Engineering Vibration, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou 510006, China; School of Physics and Electronic Science, Qiannan Normal University for Nationalities, Duyun City 558000, China); Fu, Jiyang (Reserch Center for Wind Engineering and Engineering Vibration, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou 510006, China); Xiong, Chao (Reserch Center for Wind Engineering and Engineering Vibration, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou 510006, China)","Fu, Jiyang (Guangzhou University)","Wu, Nan (Guangzhou University; Qiannan Normal College For Nationalities); Fu, Jiyang (Guangzhou University); Xiong, Chao (Guangzhou University)",3,3,,1.2,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/22/7890/pdf?version=1668052302,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152632466,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) with a 10% volume concentration was used to treat these coal samples. The pore structure characteristics and gas permeability of this coal with different treatment times were measured by laboratory experiments. The fractal theory was introduced to analyze the complexity of the sample pore and the changing rules of coal permeability. The research results show that acid liquor has a significant influence on the pore structure of YW coal. Under the effect of acid treatment, the micropore volume of the coal sample is reduced, but both the mesopore and macropore volume are increased. The fractal dimension of acidulated coal samples changes in the range of 2.57-2.81, and it is exponentially decreased with the increase of the treatment time. This indicates that the acid treatment can make the YW coal surface become smooth, and the pore structure tends to be smooth. The acidification method is able to effectively enhance the coal permeability with a maximum increment of about 9.43 times. After 30 h of acid treatment, the total pore volume, fractal dimension, and gas permeability of this coal tend to be stable. The acid treatment time should be controlled at around 30 h.","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 52274173, 52004042), the Open Research Fund of Hubei Key Laboratory for Efficient Utilization and Agglomeration of Metallurgic Mineral Resources, Wuhan University of Science and Technology (2022zy001), and the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Coal Mine Safety Technology, China Coal Technology &amp; Engineering Group Shenyang Research Institute (2022-KF-23-06).",,ACS Omega,,,,2023-08-08,2023,2023-08-08,2023-08-22,8,33,30213-30220,,,"Qin, Xinglin; Cao, Yaolin; Liu, Xianfeng; Wang, Longkang; Nie, Baisheng","Qin, Xinglin (China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp.

METHODS: This was an IRB-approved retrospective study of 137 subjects with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with subfoveal GA. Based on sfGA status at year five, eyes were categorized as ""Progressors"" and ""Non-progressors"". FD analysis allows quantification of the degree of shape complexity and architectural disorder associated with a structure. To characterize the structural irregularities along the sub-RPE surface between the two groups of patients, a total of 15 shape descriptors of FD were extracted from the sub-RPE compartment of baseline OCT scans. The top four features were identified using minimum Redundancy maximum Relevance (mRmR) feature selection method and evaluated with Random Forest (RF) classifier using three-fold cross validation from the training set (N = 90). Classifier performance was subsequently validated on the independent test set (N = 47).
RESULTS: Using the top four FD features, a RF classifier yielded an AUC of 0.85 on the independent test set. Mean fractal entropy (p-value = 4.8e-05) was identified as the most significant biomarker; higher values of entropy being associated with greater shape disorder and risk for sfGA progression.
CONCLUSIONS: FD assessment holds promise for identifying high-risk eyes for GA progression.
SIGNIFICANCE: With further validation, FD features could be potentially used for clinical trial enrichment and assessments for therapeutic response in dry AMD patients.","The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, or the United States Government.

Consequently, it is important to understand their effects and remediation. Resilience reflects the ability of an ecosystem to absorb change, which is important for understanding ecological dynamics and trajectories. To describe the impact of a powerful storm on coral reef structural complexity, we used novel computational tools and detailed 3D reconstructions captured at three time points over three years. Our data-set Reefs4D of 21 co-registered image-based models enabled us to calculate the differences at seven sites over time and is released with the paper. We employed six geometrical metrics, two of which are new algorithms for calculating fractal dimension of reefs in full 3D. We conducted a multivariate analysis to reveal which sites were affected the most and their relative recovery. We also explored the changes in fractal dimension per size category using our cube-counting algorithm. Three metrics showed a significant difference between time points, i.e., decline and subsequent recovery in structural complexity. The multivariate analysis and the results per size category showed a similar trend. Coral reef resilience has been the subject of seminal studies in ecology. We add important information to the discussion by focusing on 3D structure through image-based modeling. The full picture shows resilience in structural complexity, suggesting that the reef has not gone through a catastrophic phase shift. Our novel analysis framework is widely transferable and useful for research, monitoring, and management.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Methods: We used two datasets: ""Caledonia,"" healthy adults imaged multiple times in quick succession for research (26 subjects, 39 eyes, 377 color fundus images), and GRAPE, glaucoma patients with baseline and follow-up visits (106 subjects, 196 eyes, 392 images). Mean follow-up time was 18.3 months in GRAPE; thus it provides a pessimistic lower bound because vasculature could change. FD was computed with DART and AutoMorph. Image quality was assessed with QuickQual, but no images were initially excluded. Pearson, Spearman, and intraclass correlation (ICC) were used for population-level repeatability. For individual-level repeatability, we introduce measurement noise parameter λ, which is within-eye standard deviation (SD) of FD measurements in units of between-eyes SD.
Results: In Caledonia, ICC was 0.8153 for DART and 0.5779 for AutoMorph, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and last image) 0.7857/0.7824 for DART, and 0.3933/0.6253 for AutoMorph. In GRAPE, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and next visit) was 0.7479/0.7474 for DART, and 0.7109/0.7208 for AutoMorph (all P < 0.0001). Median λ in Caledonia without exclusions was 3.55% for DART and 12.65% for AutoMorph and improved to up to 1.67% and 6.64% with quality-based exclusions, respectively. Quality exclusions primarily mitigated large outliers. Worst quality in an eye correlated strongly with λ (Pearson 0.5350-0.7550, depending on dataset and method, all P < 0.0001).
Conclusions: Repeatability was sufficient for individual-level predictions in heterogeneous populations. DART performed better on all metrics and might be able to detect small, longitudinal changes, highlighting the potential of robust methods.","The authors thank all participants in the studies used in this paper.

We model this random force by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H≥1/2≡H_{BM}, where H_{BM} stands for the one-dimensional Brownian motion. By manipulating the deterministic force, we design a scale-invariant equation describing self-similar traces which lack conformal invariance. The model is investigated in terms of the ""input diffusivity parameter"" κ, which coincides with the one of the ordinary Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) at H=H_{BM}. In our numerical investigation, we focus on the scaling properties of the traces generated for κ=2,3, κ=4, and κ=6,8 as the representatives, respectively, of the dilute phase, the transition point, and the dense phase of the ordinary SLE. The resulting traces are shown to be scale invariant. Using two equivalent schemes, we extract the fractal dimension, D_{f}(H), of the traces which decrease monotonically with increasing H, reaching D_{f}=1 at H=1 for all κ values. The left passage probability (LPP) test demonstrates that, for H values not far from the uncorrelated case (small ε_{H}≡H-H_{BM}/H_{BM}), the prediction of the ordinary SLE is applicable with an effective diffusivity parameter κ_{eff}. Not surprisingly, the κ_{eff}'s do not fulfill the prediction of SLE for the relation between D_{f}(H) and the diffusivity parameter.","Author J.S.A. thanks the Brazilian agencies CNPq, CAPES, and FUNCAP for financial support.",,Physical Review E,,,,2022-02-02,2022,2022-02-02,2022-02,105,2,024103,,,"Tizdast, S.; Ebadi, Z.; Cheraghalizadeh, J.; Najafi, M.

EEG complexity measures have previously been shown to positively correlate with clinical depression. In this study, resting state EEG recordings were taken across multiple sessions and days with both eyes open and eyes closed conditions from a total of 306 subjects, 62 of which were in a current depressive episode, and 81 of which had a history of diagnosed depression but were not currently depressed. Three different EEG montages (mastoids, average, and Laplacian) were also computed. Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) and sample entropy (SampEn) were calculated for each unique condition. The complexity metrics showed high internal consistency within session and high stability across days. Higher complexity was found in open-eye recordings compared to closed eyes. The predicted correlation between complexity and depression was not found. However, an unexpected sex effect was observed, in which males and females exhibited different topographic patterns of complexity.",,,Psychophysiology,,,"Male; Female; Humans; Electroencephalography; Benchmarking; Fractals; Depressive Disorder, Major; Biomarkers",2023-02-22,2023,2023-02-22,2023-08,60,8,e14274,,,"Lord, Brian; Allen, John J.

Computed tomography technology was used to scan the three-dimensional morphology of the fracture network before and after fracturing, then AVIZO software was used to reconstruct the internal fractures of the coal sample, and fractal theory was used to quantify the fractures. The results show that (1) the sudden increase of the pump pressure curve and acoustic emission signal is an important identification feature of hydraulic fractures, and the in situ stress difference coefficient plays a leading role in the complexity of coal and rock fractures. (2) When a hydraulic fracture encounters a primary fracture in the process of expansion, the opening of the primary fracture, the penetration, bifurcation, and turning of the hydraulic fracture are the main reasons for the formation of complex fractures, and the existence of a large number of primary fractures is the basis for the formation of complex fractures. (3) The fracture shape of coal hydraulic fracturing can be divided into three categories: complex fracture, plane fracture + cross fracture, and inverted T-shaped fracture. The fracture shape is closely related to the original fracture shape. The research results of this paper provide strong theoretical and technical support for coalbed methane mining design such as Zhijin high-rank coal reservoirs.","This study was supported by Guizhou Provincial Geological Exploration Fund (208-9912-JBN-UTS0)and 52000021MGQSE7S7K6PRP and the Graduate Research and Innovation Foundation of Chongqing, China (Grant No.CYB20023) and the Open Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Water Resource Protection and Utilization in Coal Mining Grant number GJNY-18-73.10, and Guizhou Provincial Fund Project (Grant Nos.

In this study, a cross-linking agglutination reaction was carried out using a tetravalent Neu5Acα2,6LacNAc-glycocluster and Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin (SSA). The scattering intensity of time-resolved F-SLS increased with formation of the Neu5Acα2,6LacNAc-glycocluster-SSA cross-linked complex. Using this approach, fine sequential cross-linking agglutination between glycoclusters and lectins was observed in real-time. The rate of increase in the intensity of time-resolved F-SLS increased with the concentration of sialo-glycoclusters and SSA. Structural analysis based on the fractal dimension using time-resolved F-SLS patterns revealed that the density of the aggregates changed with progression of the cross-linking reaction until equilibrium was reached. This is the first report to evaluate the cross-linking agglutination reaction between glycoclusters and lectins and analysis of the subsequent structure of the obtained aggregates using time-resolved measurements of F-SLS.",,This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 20K05855 (M.O.) and 20H02608 (T.W.).,Bioscience Biotechnology and Biochemistry,,,Lectins; Carbohydrates; Hexoses; Agglutination; Plant Lectins,2023-06-22,2023,2023-06-22,2023-08-23,87,9,1036-1044,,,"Ogata, Makoto; Onoda, Takashi; Wakamatsu, Takashi","Ogata, Makoto (Faculty of Food and Agricultural Sciences, Fukushima University, 1 Kanayagawa, Fukushima city, Fukushima, Japan; Department of Applied Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Institute of Technology, Fukushima College, 30 Nagao, Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan); Onoda, Takashi (Department of Applied Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Institute of Technology, Fukushima College, 30 Nagao, Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan); Wakamatsu, Takashi (Department of Electrical and Electronic System Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Fukushima College, 30 Nagao, Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan; Department of Industrial Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Ibaraki College, 866 Nakane, Hitachinaka, Ibaraki, Japan)","Ogata, Makoto (Fukushima University; Department of Applied Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Institute of Technology, Fukushima College, 30 Nagao, Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan); Wakamatsu, Takashi (Department of Electrical and Electronic System Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Fukushima College, 30 Nagao, Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan; National Institute of Technology)","Ogata, Makoto (Fukushima University; Department of Applied Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Institute of Technology, Fukushima College, 30 Nagao, Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan); Onoda, Takashi (Department of Applied Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Institute of Technology, Fukushima College, 30 Nagao, Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan); Wakamatsu, Takashi (Department of Electrical and Electronic System Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Fukushima College, 30 Nagao, Iwaki, Fukushima, Japan; National Institute of Technology)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160025504,31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 3106 Industrial Biotechnology; 3107 Microbiology,

METHODS: Thirty-eight WMH participants were dementia and stroke-free, and 37 healthy controls were enrolled. Optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) was used to image the superficial vascular complex (SVC), deep vascular complex (DVC), and inner vascular complex (IVC) in a 2.5-mm diameter concentric circle (excluding the foveal avascular zone FAZ). A commercial algorithm was used to quantify the complexity and density of the three capillary layers by fractal analysis.
RESULTS: WMH participants showed significantly lower FD value in the SVC (P = 0.002), DVC (P < 0.001) and IVC (P = 0.012) macula microvasculature compared with control group. After adjusting for risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, age and gender) SVC (P = 0.035) and IVC (P = 0.030) significantly correlated with serum uric acid.
CONCLUSION: Serum uric acid levels are associated with microvascular changes in WMH. Fractal dimension based on OCTA imaging could help quantitatively characterize the macula microvasculature changes in WMH and may be a potential screening tool to detect serum uric acid level changes.",Declared none.,None.,Current Neurovascular Research,,,"Humans; Case-Control Studies; Hypertension; Microvessels; Uric Acid; White Matter; Macula Lutea; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Fractals; Middle Aged; Aged",2023-01-01,2023,2023-01-01,2023,20,1,132-139,,,"Wei, Ruili; Xie, Jianyang; Meng, Fangxia; He, Fangping; Liu, Jiang; Zhao, Yitian; Liang, Hui","Wei, Ruili (Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China.); Xie, Jianyang (Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, China.); Meng, Fangxia (Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China.); He, Fangping (Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China.); Liu, Jiang (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.); Zhao, Yitian (Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, China.); Liang, Hui (Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China.)","Zhao, Yitian (Ningbo Institute of Industrial Technology); Liang, Hui (Zhejiang University)","Wei, Ruili (Zhejiang University); Xie, Jianyang (Ningbo Institute of Industrial Technology); Meng, Fangxia (Zhejiang University); He, Fangping (Zhejiang University); Liu, Jiang (Southern University of Science and Technology); Zhao, Yitian (Ningbo Institute of Industrial Technology); Liang, Hui (Zhejiang University)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.2174/1567202620666221027095220,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152311921,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Previous studies suggest that the age effect is more pronounced in the frontal lobe. However, our knowledge of structural complexity changes in male and female brains is still limited. We measured cortical ribbon complexity through fractal dimension (FD) analysis at the hemisphere and lobe level in 7010 individuals from the UK Biobank imaging cohort to study age-related sex differences (3332 males, age ranged 45-79 years). FD decreases significantly with age and sexual dimorphism exists. With correction for brain size, females showed higher complexity in the left hemisphere and left and right parietal lobes whereas males showed higher complexity in the right temporal and left and right occipital lobes. A nonlinear age effect was observed in the left and right frontal, and right temporal lobes. Differential patterns of age effects were observed in both sexes with relatively more age-affected regions in males. Significantly higher rightward asymmetries at hemisphere, frontal, parietal, and occipital lobe level and higher leftward asymmetry in temporal lobe were observed. There was no age-by-sex-by asymmetry interaction in any region. When controlling for brain size, the leftward hemispheric, and temporal lobe asymmetry decreased with age. Males had significantly lower asymmetry between hemispheres and higher asymmetry in the parietal and occipital lobes than females. This work provides distinct patterns of age-related sex and asymmetry differences that can aid in the future development of sex-specific models of the normal brain to ascribe cognitive functional significance of these patterns in ageing.",This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank resource.

The use of Fractal Dimension (FD) has evolved to be used as a measure for trabecular changes depicting implant stability before and after implant placement. The objective of this systematic review was to qualitatively analyse the available scientific literature describing the use of FD as a tool to measure implant stability on the basis of trabecular changes. An electronic search in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus was carried out using relevant keywords, such as: fractal dimension; fractal analysis; dental implants; implant stability; osseointegration, etc. Studies reporting the use of FD as a tool to measure implant stability were included and subjected to qualitative analysis using ROBINS-I and Cochrane risk of bias assessment criteria. Fourteen studies were included in this review. Results showed that FD was found to be used solely as a measure of implant stability in seven studies, out of which six studies showed an increment in FD values. The majority of studies concluded with a statistical correlation between FD and respective other assessment methods used. FD may not serve as a sole indicator of implant stability; however, it can be used as an adjunct to conventional methods along with additional fractal factors.",,This research received no external funding.,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,Francisco Mesa,,2022-07-13,2022,2022-07-13,,11,14,4051,,,"Mishra, Sukanya;

This paper reports on the ""Cyberforest Experiment"" conducted in the open-air Paneveggio forest in Valle di Fiemme, Trento, Italy, where spruce (i.e., Picea abies) is cultivated. Our analysis of the bioelectric potentials reveals a strong correlation between higher-order complexity measurements and thermodynamic entropy and suggests that bioelectrical signals can reflect the metabolic activity of plants. Additionally, temporal correlations of bioelectric signals from different trees may be precisely synchronized or may lag behind. These correlations are further explored through the lens of quantum field theory, suggesting that the forest can be viewed as a collective array of in-phase elements whose correlation is naturally tuned depending on the environmental conditions. These results provide compelling evidence for the potential of living plant ecosystems as environmental sensors.","The greatest acknowledgement for their fundamental contribution to the realization of the entire infrastructure goes to Alessandro Bernard, Paolo Ceretto, and Massimo Arvat.

However, these assumptions are typically not fulfilled in complex natural sample environments. Here, we introduce dual-angle interferometric scattering microscopy (DAISY), enabling optical quantification of both size and polarizability of individual nanoparticles (radius <170 nm) without requiring a priori information regarding the surrounding media or super-resolution imaging. DAISY achieves this by combining the information contained in concurrently measured forward and backward scattering images through twilight off-axis holography and interferometric scattering (iSCAT). Going beyond particle size and polarizability, single-particle morphology can be deduced from the fact that the hydrodynamic radius relates to the outer particle radius, while the scattering-based size estimate depends on the internal mass distribution of the particles. We demonstrate this by differentiating biomolecular fractal aggregates from spherical particles in fetal bovine serum at the single-particle level.","This research was funded by the Swedish research council, grant number 2019-05071, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation grant number 2019-0577, and Chalmers Area of Advance Nano.

STUDY DESIGN: In total, 28 female patients with COD and 28 age-matched controls were selected retrospectively. Inferior cross-sectional CTh was measured at the symphysis (sCTh), anterior (aCTh), mental foramen (mfCTh), molar (mCTh), and posterior (pCTh) regions. The alternate measurement of mean CTh of the volume including buccal, lingual, and inferior cortices between the mental foramina (alternate CTh) was measured in ImageJ. FD was calculated in cortical and trabecular bone. Data were analyzed for significance of differences in CTh and FD between patient groups and for correlation of inferior and alternate CTh measurements.
RESULTS: Inferior CTh values were lower overall in the patients with COD than in the controls (P = .01), specifically at sCTh, mCTh, and pCTh (P ≤ .042). Alternate CTh was also significantly lower in the COD group (P = .005). There was a significant correlation between inferior and alternate CTh measurements (r = 0.636, P < .001). No significant differences were observed in cortical or trabecular FD between groups (P ≥ .072).
CONCLUSIONS: Female patients with COD had significantly lower inferior and alternate CTh than healthy controls.

In aquatic environments dominated by fine, cohesive or mixed sediments they can dominate suspended sediment flux. Consequently, monitoring and modelling the behaviour, transport and distribution of flocs is very important for many aquatic industries, maintenance of waterways and conservation and management of aquatic waterbodies. Mathematical models that predict the behaviour of flocs rely on the accurate assessments of the size, shape, density, porosity and fractal dimension of flocs. These inherently 3-dimensional (3D) characteristics are typically derived from 2-dimensional (2D) data, largely due to the challenges associated with sampling, capturing, imaging and quantifying these fragile aggregates. We have developed new volumetric microscopy techniques which can quantify 3D internal and external structures and characteristics of sediment flocs. Here, these techniques were applied to quantify the 3D size (volume), shape and fractal dimension of natural and artificial sediment flocs and compare them to standard 2D approaches. Our study demonstrates that 2D approaches are under-estimating shape complexity and over-estimating the size and mass settling flux of flocs by up to two orders of magnitude, and the discrepancy between 2D and 3D is most marked for natural, organic rich macroflocs. Our study has significant implications for estimations of sediment flux at local to global scales within in aquatic environments. These new data and approaches offer the potential to improve the current parameterisation of sediment transport models and to improve the accuracy of current field-monitoring techniques.","This research was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (grant number NE/011678/1 and NE/M009726/1).

We present a thorough investigation of a hybrid nanomaterial based on the protein-mediated aggregation of gold nanoparticles at varying protein concentration, pH and temperature. By combining Small Angle X-ray Scattering with extinction spectroscopy, we are able to frame the morphological features of the formed fractal aggregates in a theoretical model based on patchy interactions. Based on this, we established the main factors that determine the assembly process and their strong correlation with the optical properties of the assemblies. Moreover, the calibration curves that we obtained for each parameter investigated based on the extinction spectra point out to the notable flexibility of this nanomaterial, enabling the selection of different working ranges with high sensitivity.

The coal pore structure changes to some extent in the process of coal pulverization and has a related impact on the dynamic parameters of coal particle gas desorption. To understand the impact of desorption damage on the dynamic characteristics of coal particle gas desorption, in this paper, a self-developed coal particle gas desorption test device is used to measure the amount of methane desorption of different coal samples repeatedly desorbed under the same adsorption equilibrium pressure. The results show that the methane desorption kinetic curves of the four coal samples based on desorption damage basically have the same trend. Nie's diffusion model can better describe the methane desorption characteristics of coal particles. After desorption, the methane desorption amount, initial desorption velocity, diffusion ability, and ultimate amount of methane desorption of the coal samples are greater than those before desorption. The desorption damage affects the relevant dynamic parameters of the coal particle gas diffusion model, and its impact on the outburst coal is greater than that on raw coal. In addition, the pore size distribution and change characteristics of the coal samples before and after desorption are analyzed quantitatively via a low-temperature liquid nitrogen adsorption test and fractal dimension-related theory. It was found that the pore volume peak area of the coal samples affected by desorption damage within each pore size range was significantly larger than that before desorption. Among them, micropores have the most significant impact on the desorption damage of coal samples, and the peak area of the pore volume of protruding coal is greater than that of raw coal, indicating that the internal pores of coal after desorption damage are more developed than those of raw coal.",We appreciate the financial support of the Discipline Innovation Team of Liaoning Technical University (Grant no.

The main objective of this review was to collate studies that utilized chaotic measures and nonlinear dynamical analysis in EEG of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and to discuss the contributions of chaos theory techniques to understanding, diagnosing, and treating MS.
Methods: Using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA), the databases EbscoHost, IEEE, ProQuest, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for publications that applied chaos theory in EEG analysis of MS patients.
Results: A bibliographic analysis was performed using VOSviewer software keyword co-occurrence analysis indicated that MS was the focus of the research and that research on MS diagnosis has shifted from conventional methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging, to EEG techniques in recent years. A total of 17 studies were included in this review. Among the included articles, nine studies examined resting-state, and eight examined task-based conditions.
Conclusion: Although nonlinear EEG analysis of MS is a relatively novel area of research, the findings have been demonstrated to be informative and effective. The most frequently used nonlinear dynamics analyses were fractal dimension, recurrence quantification analysis, mutual information, and coherence. Each analysis selected provided a unique assessment to fulfill the objective of this review.

The different environment (water-bearing state) of the filling body in the underground stope exerts a complex impact on the mechanical behavior of the filling body. Therefore, six groups of cemented filling body specimens with different states were formed and subjected to dynamic uniaxial impact tests. The effects of water content on the mechanical properties, fractal dimension, and deformation damage characteristics of the cemented backfill under dynamic load were analyzed in depth, and a dynamic damage constitutive model that considers water damage and the compaction stage was established. The results indicate the following: (1) Due to the change of the specimen from the dry state to the water saturation state, the dynamic compressive strength of the cemented filling body decreases from 5.03 Mpa to 1.79 Mpa; however, the ductility of the specimen generally increases, and the filling body specimens with different water contents mainly exhibit tensile failure. (2) There is a significant nonlinear relationship between the water content and the fractal dimension Db of the cemented backfill specimen, and the growth rate of the fractal dimension Db tends to slow down with the increase in the water content. (3) From the energy evolution perspective, the water content of the specimen exerts a significant effect on the elastic deformation and failure stage of the stress-strain curve, and the slope of the dissipated energy-strain curve decreases with the increase in water content. (4) Based on the Weibull distribution and damage theory, a statistical damage constitutive model of cemented backfill was established, and it was compared with the experimental curve to verify the rationality of the model. Therefore, the relationship between stress and damage and the strain curves is discussed, and it is inferred that the damage evolution curve of cemented backfill is a typical S-shaped curve that exhibits a stable development-rapid increase-tending to be gentle.

A Generation 100 substudy,"Physical inactivity has been identified as an important risk factor for dementia. High levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) have been shown to reduce the risk of dementia. However, the mechanism by which exercise affects brain health is still debated. Fractal dimension (FD) is an index that quantifies the structural complexity of the brain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a 5-year exercise intervention on the structural complexity of the brain, measured through the FD, in a subset of 105 healthy older adults participating in the randomized controlled trial Generation 100 Study. The subjects were randomized into control, moderate intensity continuous training, and high intensity interval training groups. Both brain MRI and CRF were acquired at baseline and at 1-, 3- and 5-years follow-ups. Cortical thickness and volume data were extracted with FreeSurfer, and FD of the cortical lobes, cerebral and cerebellar gray and white matter were computed. CRF was measured as peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) using ergospirometry during graded maximal exercise testing. Linear mixed models were used to investigate exercise group differences and possible CRF effects on the brain's structural complexity. Associations between change over time in CRF and FD were performed if there was a significant association between CRF and FD. There were no effects of group membership on the structural complexity. However, we found a positive association between CRF and the cerebral gray matter FD (p < 0.001) and the temporal lobe gray matter FD (p < 0.001). This effect was not present for cortical thickness, suggesting that FD is a more sensitive index of structural changes. The change over time in CRF was associated with the change in temporal lobe gray matter FD from baseline to 5-year follow-up (p < 0.05). No association of the change was found between CRF and cerebral gray matter FD. These results demonstrated that entering old age with high and preserved CRF levels protected against loss of structural complexity in areas sensitive to aging and age-related pathology.","The authors would like to thank all participants for taking part in the study.

The study aimed to investigate the effect of mixed acid on the micronano mechanical properties and permeability of the coal seam. The surface morphology of acidified coal was analyzed from the micronano scale using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, the micronano scale mechanical characteristics of acidified coal were examined using the mechanical mode in an atomic force microscope. Furthermore, the complexity and connectivity of the micronano pores of samples were investigated using the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption and mercury intrusion porosimetry methods and the fractal theory. The results indicated that the surface minerals of acidified coal were dissolved, loosening the coal and increasing the complexity of the pore structure. Mineral deformation and pore deformation weakened the mechanical properties of coal at the micronano scale, and the mean elastic modulus of acidified coal (B# and E#) decreased by 28.78 and 25.66% compared to that of raw coal. The acid solution effectively enlarged the pore diameter, transitioning from micropores to mesopores and macropores, and the total pore volume of acidified coal increased by 1.88 times and 1.25 times, Kn increased from 0.064 to 0.581 and 0.37, respectively. The type of methane diffusion in the diffusion pores changed from Knudsen diffusion to transition-type diffusion. The tortuosity of the pore structure of acidified coal decreased, the fractal dimension of the tortuosity of the pore structure decreased, and the permeability increased by nearly three times. The research results indicate that the mechanical properties of coal decrease after acidification and that the microstructural changes can promote methane migration (diffusion-seepage), which can provide theoretical guidance for coalbed methane extraction in low-permeability coal reservoirs.","The research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 52164015), and supported by Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Projects (no.

Nevertheless, nanoscale insights on the carbon fiber surface in relationship with its chemical modification are still rarely addressed. Here, we demonstrate a critical insight on the nanoscale surface topography characterization of modified novel carbon fibers using high-resolution atomic force microscopy at multiple length scales. We compare the nanoscale surface characteristics relevant to their role in controlling interfacial interactions for carbon fibers manufactured at two different tensions and two distinct chemically functionalized coatings. We used surface dimple (also known as nanopores) profiling, microroughness analysis, power spectral density analysis, and adhesion and electrostatic potential mapping to reveal the fine details of surface characteristics at different length scales. This analysis demonstrates that the carbon fibers processed at lower tension possess a higher fractal dimension with a more corrugated surface and higher surface roughness, which leads to increased surface adhesion and energy dissipation across nano- and microscales. Furthermore, electrochemical surface modification with amine- and fluoro-functional groups significantly masks the microroughness inherent to these fibers. This results in increased fractal dimension and decreased energy dissipation and adhesion due to the high chemical reactivity in the areas of asperities and surface defects combined with a significant increase in the surface potential, as revealed by Kelvin probe mapping. These local surface properties of carbon fibers are crucial for designing next-generation fiber composites with predictable interfacial strength and the overall mechanical performance by considering the fiber surface topography for proper control of interphase formation.",Financial support for this research was provided by the Air Force Research Laboratory via UTC contract 165852-18F5828-19-16-C1.

Two sediments were used: a fine, milled calcite that was flocculated with anionic polyacrylamide and naturally flocculated pond sludge. Particles were initially measured independently by light-based techniques to gain size, the coefficient of variation (COV), and fractal dimensions. For acoustic experiments, a bespoke, high-fidelity ABS was employed with 1, 2.25, and 5 MHz probes and a recirculating mixing tank. Initially, the concentration independent attenuation and backscatter coefficients were measured for each system using a robust calibration procedure at multiple concentrations. Comparisons of the total scattering cross-section (χ) and form function (f) were made between the experimental data and two semiempirical models: a Solid Scattering model and a Hybrid model (where the effects of bound fluid are incorporated). Experimental data compared more closely to the Solid Scattering model, as it was assumed scattering was dominated by small, bound ""flocculi"" rather than the macroscopic structure. However, if the COV was used as a fit parameter, the hybrid model could give equally accurate fits for a range of input aggregate sizes, highlighting that important size and structure information can be gained from the acoustic models if there is some a priori system data. Additionally, dual-frequency inversions were undertaken to measure concentration profiles for various frequency pairs. Here, the lowest frequency pair gave the best performance (with accurate measurements in the range of 2-35 g·L-1) as interparticle scattering was lowest.","The authors would like to thank Sellafield Ltd. and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) UK for project funding, as part of the Decommissioning, Immobilisation and Storage Solutions for Nuclear Waste Inventories (DISTINCTIVE) consortium (Grant No. EP/L014041/1).

While rural settlements emerge as parts of agricultural landscapes, cities typically evolve in economically strategic locations, and over time form hierarchical systems of cities. Purposeful planning and the collective, self-organized behavior of the inhabitants interact in the development of regional settlement patterns. Since self-organizing systems often produce fractal patterns in nature, this study combines approaches of land use science, city ranking, and urban planning under a fractal theory framework, to analyze the settlement system of the Indian Punjab. Scaling levels were defined by discontinuities in the size distribution of built-up areas (Global Urban Footprint), which correlated to population-based classifications (r = 0.9591). Self-similarity across scales was supported by geo-statistical similarity (p < 0.05) of distances and angles between settlements of successive classes, and the overall fractal dimension of DB = 1.95. When compared to a modeled Sierpinski Carpet, more than 50% of the settlements met the fractal geometry rules at larger scales. The spatial distribution of small villages, however, deviated, indicating a scale-related shift in organizing principles. Explicitly acknowledging cross-scale relations and self-organisation in regional planning policies may lead to more sustainable settlement structures that are in harmony with natural system properties.","This work was inspired by discussions within the Indo-German Research Unit FOR2432 “Social-Ecological Systems in the Indian Rural-Urban Interface: Functions, Scales, and Dynamics of Transitions” based at the University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore (UASB, GKVK Campus) and jointly funded by the German Science Foundation (DFG) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India.

Accordingly, the radon exhalationed from building materials is of increasing concern; however, there is little research on radon exhalation from loess. In this study, the pore structure and radon exhalation characteristics of heat-treated loess were investigated by nitrogen adsorption tests, swept surface electron microscopy, and radon measurements. The rate of radon exhalation increases linearly with temperature until 400 °C and then decreases exponentially. Changes in the internal pore structure (pore type, surface morphology, and specific surface area) of loess are strongly correlated with the radon exhalation rate. The volume of micropores (<2 nm diameter) is an important influence on radon exhalation ability, which is closely related to the fractal dimension of the micropore structure after heating.

METHODS: PR and sagittal CBCT slices of 24 MRONJ patients and 22 healthy controls were used for the measurements of mandibular cortical thickness (MCT), fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, mean gray value (MGV), bone area fraction (BA/TA), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), trabecular number (Tb.N). MCT was measured in the mental foramen region. While FD and lacunarity were measured on mandibular trabecular and cortical regions of interest (ROIs), the remaining parameters were measured on trabecular ROIs. The independent samples t-test was used to compare the measurements between MRONJ and control group for both imaging modalities (p = 0.05).
RESULTS: MCT was the only parameter that differentiated MRONJ-affected bone in both PR and CBCT (p < 0.05). None of the remaining parameters revealed any difference for MRONJ-affected bone in CBCT (p > 0.05). FD, lacunarity, MGV, BA/TA, and Tb.Sp could distinguish MRONJ-affected trabecular bone in PR (p < 0.05). The correspondent ROI for both imaging methods that was reliable for detecting MRONJ-affected bone was the trabecular bone distal to the mental foramen above the inferior alveolar canal (ROI-3).
CONCLUSIONS: MCT is a reliable parameter for the discrimination of MRONJ-affected bone in both PR and CBCT images. PR may be used to detect MRONJ-affected trabecular bone using FD, lacunarity, MGV, BA/TA, and Tb.Sp measurements as well.",This study was presented at the CED/NOF IADR Oral Health Research Congress in September 2024 under the title “Comparison of 3D Bone Properties of MRONJ Using 2D&amp;3D Images” and was awarded with the Robert Frank Award in the Senior/Clinical Research category.,The authors declare that they have received no financial support.,Dentomaxillofacial Radiology,,,,2024-05-29,2024,2024-05-29,2024-05-29,,,twae024,,,"Aslan, Elif; Onem, Erinc; Mert, Ali; Baksi, B Guniz","Aslan, Elif (Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Ege University School of Dentistry, Izmir, 35040, Turkey); Onem, Erinc (Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Ege University School of Dentistry, Izmir, 35040, Turkey); Mert, Ali (Department of Statistics, Ege University School of Science, Izmir, 35040, Turkey); Baksi, B Guniz (Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Ege University School of Dentistry, Izmir, 35040, Turkey)","Aslan, Elif (Ege University)","Aslan, Elif (Ege University); Onem, Erinc (Ege University); Mert, Ali (Ege University); Baksi, B Guniz (Ege University)",0,0,,,https://academic.oup.com/dmfr/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/dmfr/twae024/57986630/twae024.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172139373,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,3 Good Health and Well Being

As fractal parameters of microvasculature have shown to be reliable quantitative biomarkers in brain tumors, there has been similar success in measuring the architecture of tumor tissue using FA in other tumor types. However, evaluating fractal parameters of tissue structure in relation to the microvasculature has not yet been implemented in GBM. We aimed to assess the utility of this methodology in quantifying structural characteristics of GBM cytoarchitecture and vascularity by correlating fractal parameters with gene expression.
METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens were retrospectively collected from 43 patients following resection of a newly diagnosed GBM; 4 normal brain specimens were obtained from epilepsy surgeries as controls. Tumor samples were processed using FA employing a software-based box-counting method algorithm and custom messenger RNA expression assays. Fractal parameters were then correlated with clinical features, outcomes, and a panel of 92 genes associated with vascularity and angiogenesis.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis demonstrated that fractal-based indices were not adequate parameters for distinction of GBM cytoarchitecture compared with normal brain specimens. Correlation analysis of our gene expression findings suggested that hematoxylin and eosin-based FA may have adequate sensitivity to detect associations with vascular gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of neuropathological assessment and histology does not provide optimized data for FA in GBM. However, an association between FA and gene expression in GBM of genes pertaining to cytoarchitecture and angiogenesis warrants further investigation.",,"Conflict of interest statement: Funding for this study was provided by the Shoemaker Prize for Neurodegenerative Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Medicine; Summer Research Grant, University of Nebraska Medical Center; Eppley Institute Cancer Biology Training Grant (T32CA009476); Fred Pamela Buffett Cancer Center Support Grant (P30 CA036727).

Today, the industry looks to tailings dams to recover more water and, thus, increase recirculation. The migration of interstitial water due to the consolidation of particle networks can give rise to large water mirrors in different dam areas. These pools can contain enough water to be recovered and recirculated if the external stress caused by the weight of the pulp exceeds the compressive yield stress. The density and rheological properties of the discarded pulps determine the feasibility of water expulsion during tailings consolidation. As these conditions are largely established in the thickening stage, it is necessary to revisit operations, looking at the dam as a water source. Thus, a thorough understanding of the compressive properties that determine the level of consolidation of typical pulps and their relationships to aggregate properties, such as size and fractal dimension, is crucial. Here, the effect of two types of water, industrial water and synthetic seawater, on kaolin flocculation, sedimentation rate, yield stress, and compressive yield stress were studied. In addition, the relationship of these properties with the flocculant dose and the resulting aggregate size and fractal dimension was examined. One promising finding to practitioners was that salt and small doses of high molecular weight flocculant improved the consolidation of kaolin slurries under compression. These conditions generated low compressive yield stress compared to fresh water and water with low salt content, favoring the consolidation of the pulps and the release of water.",R.I.J. and P.G.T. are grateful for the financial support from the CRHIAM Project ANID/FONDAP/15130015.

In neuroscience, starting from identifying the fractal properties of neuronal and brain architecture, attention has shifted to evaluating brain signals in the time domain. Classical linear methods applied to analyzing neurophysiological signals can lead to classifying irregular components as noise, with a potential loss of information. Thus, characterizing fractal properties, namely, self-similarity, scale invariance, and fractal dimension (FD), can provide relevant information on these signals in physiological and pathological conditions. Several methods have been proposed to estimate the fractal properties of these neurophysiological signals. However, the effects of signal characteristics (e.g., its stationarity) and other signal parameters, such as sampling frequency, amplitude, and noise level, have partially been tested. In this chapter, we first outline the main properties of fractals in the domain of space (fractal geometry) and time (fractal time series). Then, after providing an overview of the available methods to estimate the FD, we test them on synthetic time series (STS) with different sampling frequencies, signal amplitudes, and noise levels. Finally, we describe and discuss the performances of each method and the effect of signal parameters on the accuracy of FD estimation.",,,Advances in Neurobiology,The Fractal Geometry of the Brain,Antonio Di Ieva,Humans; Brain; Fractals; Time Factors,2024-03-10,2024,2024-03-10,2024,36,,95-137,,,"Porcaro, Camillo; Moaveninejad, Sadaf; D’Onofrio, Valentina; DiIeva, Antonio","Porcaro, Camillo (Department of Neuroscience (DNS) and Padova Neuroscience Center (PNC), University of Padova, Padua, Italy; Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (ISTC) National Research Council (CNR), Rome, Italy; Centre for Human Brain Health, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK); Moaveninejad, Sadaf (Department of Neuroscience (DNS), University of Padova, Padua, Italy); D’Onofrio, Valentina (Padova Neuroscience Center (PNC), University of Padova, Padua, Italy); DiIeva, Antonio (Computational NeuroSurgery (CNS) Lab & Macquarie Neurosurgery, Macquarie Medical School, Faculty of Medicine, Human and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia)","Porcaro, Camillo (University of Padua; Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies; University of Birmingham)","Porcaro, Camillo (University of Padua; Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies; University of Birmingham); Moaveninejad, Sadaf (University of Padua); D’Onofrio, Valentina (University of Padua); DiIeva, Antonio (Macquarie University)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169626142,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering,

The participants were divided into nine groups (n = 16 each) based on HWMS. Fractal analysis was performed on the radiographs of the radius, the middle finger phalanges (proximal, medial and distal), and the cervical vertebral bodies (C2, C3, C4). Mean and standard deviation values, Spearman’s and Pearson correlation analyses, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis H tests and Mann-Whitney-U test were used to evaluate the data.ResultsPositive correlations were found between the FD values of the radius and HWMS or CVMS (r = .559, P = .001, r = .528 P = .001 respectively). The FD values of the radius were positively correlated with those of all cervical vertebrae (C2, C3, C4), proximal and medial phalanges as well as age. FD values measured from the proximal phalanx, medial phalanx and radius showed significant differences among both HWMS and CVMS (P < .05). HWMS was strongly correlated with CVMS (r = .929, P = .001). Age was strongly correlated with HWMS (r = .795, P = .001) and CVMS (r = .756, P = .001).

Methods: This study included 16 T2DM patients with a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of at least 26 points, as well as 16 healthy controls with normal cognitive function. The participants also completed the digit span test and digit symbol substitution test. Participants' serum levels of Interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and BDNF were also examined. Each subject underwent a high-resolution 3T structural brain MRI scan. Based on the aparc. a2009s atlas, we calculated the cortical thickness, sulcus depth, gyrification index, and fractal dimension for each participant using surface-based morphometry (SBM). Correlation analysis between cognitive measures, serum levels of cytokines and BDNF, and SBM indices were further performed.
Results: The levels of IL-4 and BDNF showed significant group differences. In the T2DM group, the sulcus depth exhibited a significant decrease in the left transverse frontopolar gyri and sulci, as well as in the right pole-occipital; the fractal dimension showed a significant increase in the right posterior-dorsal part of the cingulate gyrus; and the gyrification index significantly increased in the left inferior part of the precentral sulcus and right triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between IL-10 levels and the sulcus depth of left transverse frontopolar gyri and sulci; a significant positive correlation between the sulcus depth of the right pole-occipital and the digit span test-forward scores, and a significant negative correlation between the gyrification index of the left inferior part of the precentral sulcus and the digit span test-backward scores among T2DM participants.
Conclusion: T2DM patients without cognitive impairment displayed reductions in IL 4 and BDNF levels, as well as significant alterations in their SBM indices, indicating that prior to the emergence of cognitive impairment, the SBM indices, peripheral cytokines, and BDNF may have altered in T2DM patients. IL-10 may lessen inflammation-related brain edema and preserve sulcus depth in T2DM patients through its anti-inflammatory activity.",,The funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81920108019) covers the participants’ transportation subsidies and publication fees.,Frontiers in Neuroscience,,,,2023-04-11,2023,2023-04-11,,17,,1141261,,,"Lyu, Wenjiao; Chen, Yuna; Zhao, Kui; Tan, Xin; Wu, Ye; Qiu, Shijun","Lyu, Wenjiao (Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China); Chen, Yuna (Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China); Zhao, Kui (Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China); Tan, Xin (Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China); Wu, Ye (School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China); Qiu, Shijun (Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China)","Wu, Ye (Nanjing University of Science and Technology); Qiu, Shijun (First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine)","Lyu, Wenjiao (First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine); Chen, Yuna (First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine); Zhao, Kui (First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine); Tan, Xin (First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine); Wu, Ye (Nanjing University of Science and Technology); Qiu, Shijun (First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine)",1,1,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1141261/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157152384,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

The objective of the work is to explore the influence of tight sandstone physical characteristics, fracturing fluid composition, salinity, viscosity, surface tension on fracturing fluid imbibition, and further analyze its main controlling factors. To evaluate imbibition characteristics more deeply, the pore throat structure and micromorphology of tight sandstone before and after imbibition were described by mercury intrusion test and scanning electron microscope test, respectively. Furthermore, the mineral composition and dilatation characteristics of the tight sandstone samples were identified by XRD and a linear dilatometer, respectively. The results show that the drilled tight sandstone samples from the Shaximiao Formation reservoir have strong heterogeneity, high clay mineral content, more developed micro/nanopores, less developed fractures, and strong hydration expansion. Since the average pore throat radius of tight sandstone samples is between 0.1 and 0.2 μm, the imbibition driving force is strong. The imbibition rate is fast, and the imbibition basically reaches a steady state within 24 h, which makes the imbibition capacity basically greater than 50%. Based on the analysis of the main control factors of imbibition, the surface tension of the fluid properties has the greatest impact on the imbibition recovery factor. The result not only helps to understand the absorption mechanism of fracturing fluid in tight sandstone reservoirs and then evaluates the degree of interaction between fluid and tight sandstone but it is also crucial for the prediction of flowback rate.",This work was supported financially by the postdoctoral research program of Petrochina Southwest Oil &amp; Gas Field Company (Grant No. 20220302-20).,,ACS Omega,,,,2022-10-18,2022,2022-10-18,2022-11-01,7,43,38912-38922,,,"Zhang, Xueping; Liu, Youquan; Liu, Yuzhou; Zhong, Chuanrong","Zhang, Xueping (Research Institute of Natural Gas Technology, PetroChina Southwest Oil & Gas Field Company, Chengdu, 610213, Sichuan, P.

The associated heat release is analyzed, showing that nucleation and growth rates could be extracted with high fidelity.","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation, Grant No. 1941543, NSF Engineering Research Center for Advanced Technologies for Preservation of Biological Systems (ATP-Bio).

Using SBM analysis, we calculated and compared group differences in cortical thickness, sulcal depth, gyrification, and fractal dimension of the cerebral cortex between 18 pediatric ALL survivors treated on chemotherapy-only protocols and off treatment within 2 years, and 18 healthy controls (HCs) with two-sample t-tests [P < 0.05, family-wise error (FWE) corrected]. Relationships between abnormal cortical characteristic values and cognitive function parameters were investigated with partial correlation analysis, taking age as a covariate. We found decreased cortical thickness mainly located in the prefrontal and temporal region, and increased sulcal depth in left rostral middle frontal cortex and left pars orbitalis in the ALL survivors compared to HCs. There were no statistically significant differences in the gyrification and fractal dimension between the two groups. In ALL survivors, cortical thickness and sulcal depth of above areas values revealed no significant correlation with the cognitive function parameters. In conclusion, pediatric ALL survivors show decreased cortical thickness in prefrontal and temporal regions, and increased sulcal depth in prefrontal region. These results suggest that SBM-based approach can be used to assess changes of cortical morphological characteristics in pediatric ALL survivors.","We would like to thank all families that participated in the study for their time and dedication.

The coagulant was obtained by soaking crushed and sieved seeds in a low salinity aqueous solution: a simple and inexpensive alternative to conventional coagulants in settings where specialized expertise and equipment are lacking. The performance of M. oleifera-derived coagulants was quantified in terms of turbidity removal, bacteriophage clearance, concentration of residual organics, as well as meta-parameters such as floc size and fractal dimension. Treating high turbidity clay suspensions at the optimal coagulant dosage (14.7 mg(DOC)/L) and flocculation mixing conditions (G¯$$\overline{G }$$= 22.4 s−1) removed > 94% of turbidity, similar to that recorded in reference tests with alum. Floc size distribution shifted to larger sizes during the first 10 min of flocculation with no change afterwards, while the floc fractal dimension, Df$${D}_{f}$$, continued to increase, pointing to the gradual formation of denser (Df$${D}_{f}$$= 2.1 to 2.2), more settleable flocs. Preliminary tests with MS2 bacteriophage showed that coagulation with M. oleifera decreased the viable MS2 titre by ~ 1.3 log, which was significantly above the turbidity removal (~ 1 log). The extraction process, however, allowed a large amount of residual organics (> 78% of extracted DOC) into the treated water. Combining the coagulants with downstream filtration and adsorption, employing UV or solar disinfection, or limiting applications to non-potable reuse is suggested for mitigating the concerns related to residual DOC.","We are grateful to Phipps &amp; Bird, Inc. for donating the jar tester used in coagulation–flocculation studies and Dr. Wei Zhang for providing access to the Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS instrument in his laboratory.

We exploited intracranial electroencephalogram data from 38 cortical regions using the Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) as measure to assess brain complexity, on a dataset of 1772 electrode locations. HFD values depended on sleep stage and topography. HFD increased with higher levels of vigilance, being highest during wakefulness in the frontal lobe. HFD did not change from wake to stage N2 in temporo-occipital regions. The transverse temporal gyrus was the only area in which the HFD did not differ between any two vigilance stages. Interestingly, HFD of wakefulness and stage R were different mainly in the precentral gyrus, possibly reflecting motor inhibition in stage R. The fusiform and parahippocampal gyri were the only areas showing no difference between wakefulness and N2. Stages R and N2 were similar only for the postcentral gyrus.

The influences of hydraulic conditions, the dosage ratio of PAC-HCA complex coagulants, initial pH value, and dosage on the removal efficiency of SS, COD, and TP in domestic sewage were investigated. The fractal dimension and Zeta potential were used to verify and characterize the experimental results. The results showed that the optimum coagulant conditions were as follows: G1 = 200.0-265.0 s-1, T1 = 1.5 min, G2 = 40.0 s-1, T2 = 5 min, PAC: HCA = 25:1, dosage = 15 mL/L, pH = 8. At the mentioned point, the removal rates of SS, COD, and TP are 98.74%, 44.63%, and 89.85%, respectively. In addition, through comparative tests, PAC-HCA compound coagulants show better treatment efficiency than PAC and HCA used alone. When the HCA dosage was 15 mg/L, Zeta potential and flocs fractal dimension was 2.29 mv and 0.9844, respectively. This indicates that PAC-HCA has a good treatment effect on domestic sewage, and the mechanism of enhanced coagulation to remove nutrients is mainly electrical neutralization.","The research was supported by the Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Yellow River Water Environment in Gansu Province (20JR2RA0002), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51568034), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC040070).",,Water Science & Technology,,,Aluminum Chloride; Sewage; Water Purification; Flocculation; Aluminum Compounds,2022-08-08,2022,2022-08-08,2023-01-01,87,1,27-38,,,"Yan, Zichun; Shen, Li; Pei, Zhibing; Yang, Mingxia; Zhang, Wei","Yan, Zichun (Key Laboratory of Yellow River Water Environment of Gansu Province, Lanzhou 730070, China; School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou 730070, China); Shen, Li (School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou 730070, China); Pei, Zhibing (School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou 730070, China); Yang, Mingxia (School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou 730070, China); Zhang, Wei (School of Environmental and Municipal Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou 730070, China)","Shen, Li (Lanzhou Jiaotong University)","Yan, Zichun (Key Laboratory of Yellow River Water Environment of Gansu Province, Lanzhou 730070, China; Lanzhou Jiaotong University); Shen, Li (Lanzhou Jiaotong University); Pei, Zhibing (Lanzhou Jiaotong University); Yang, Mingxia (Lanzhou Jiaotong University); Zhang, Wei (Lanzhou Jiaotong University)",1,1,,0.25,https://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2022.240/1088215/wst2022240.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150083104,40 Engineering; 4004 Chemical Engineering; 4011 Environmental Engineering,

We aimed to investigate the alterations of structural complexity using fractal dimension (FD) analysis in patients with TAO. Thirty-nine TAO patients and 25 healthy controls underwent high-resolution 3.0 T structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). FD values of brain regions were calculated by Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12) and compared between groups. The associations between clinical variables and FD values were further estimated. We found that TAO patients exhibited significantly decreased FD values in right caudal anterior cingulate cortex, right lingual gyrus, right pars orbitalis and right cuneus cortex (FDR corrected p < 0.05). FD values of right cuneus cortex were positively correlated with visual acuity, and FD values of right caudal anterior cingulate cortex were also positively correlated with cognitive performance. Meanwhile, FD values of right lingual gyrus were found to be negatively correlated with emotional function. Our study indicated disturbed cortical complexity in brain regions corresponding to known functional deficits of vision, emotion and cognition in TAO.

In this paper, large yellow croaker was taken as the research object, and a novel cryomicroscopic system was developed to directly observe the structure of ice crystals during the freezing process. The cryoprotective effects of 4% sucrose +4% sorbitol (SU + SO), 4% xylo-oligosaccharide (XO), 4% xylo-oligosaccharide + 0.3% tetrasodium pyrophosphate (XO + TSPP) and 0.2% antifreeze protein (AFP) at different freezing temperatures were investigated. And the evaluation indicators, such as cell deformation degree, equivalent diameters, roundness, elongation and fractal dimension were introduced to quantify the damage of ice crystals to muscle tissues and fibers. The results indicate that reducing the freezing temperature and adding cryoprotectants can improve the quality of large yellow croaker. AFP has the best cryoprotective effect, with a reduction in cell deformation degree of 54.78% and 67.83% compared to the Control group at -5 °C and -20 °C, respectively. SU + SO and XO have the equivalent antifreeze effect, which is slightly inferior to XO + TSPP. In addition, physical parameters of large yellow croaker samples were measured to verify the influence of ice crystal structure on product quality. Therefore, direct observation of the ice crystal formation process and evaluation of ice crystal structure can accurately reflect the quality of frozen products, which is of great significance for the development of refrigeration and preservation technology.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.

However, the question that the MN present in all subtypes of BC are similar or different remains unanswered. We thus hypothesized that MN present in different subtypes of BC may differ in their contents which may be visible as differences in their morphologic and morphometric features. This study was thus carried out with the aim to identify the differences between MN morphometry, complexity, and texture in different subtypes of BC, such as estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive (ER+/PR+; MCF-7, T-47D), human epidermal growth factor receptor-positive (Her2 +;SKBR3) and triple-negative BC (TNBC; MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468) cell lines (CLs) by ImageJ software.
METHODS: For analysis of MN dimensions, MN irregularity, and texture, we used morphometry and two mathematical computer-assisted algorithms, i.e., fractal dimension (FD) and grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of ImageJ software.
RESULTS: MN area and perimeter values showed differences in the size of MN in different subtypes of BC, with the largest MN in TNBC CLs. GLCM parameters (entropy, angular second moment, inverse difference moment, contrast, and correlation) showed highly heterogenous texture in case of TNBC MN as compared to the others. FD analysis also revealed more complexity and irregularity in MN found in TNBC cells.
CONCLUSION: The study for the first time showed morphometric, architectural and texture related differences amongst MN present in different subtypes of BC. The above may reflect differences in their composition and contents. Further, these differences may point towards the distinct mechanisms involved in the formation of MN in different subtypes of BC that need to be explored further.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

METHODS: We recruited 31 men with SZC, 28 with CIP, and 30 with HC. We used the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders to differentiate between CIP and SZC. We processed and analyzed T1 MR images using the Surface-based Brain Morphometry (SBM) pipeline of the CAT-12 toolbox within the statistical parametric mapping. After pre-processing, volumes were segmented using surface and thickness estimation for the analysis of the region of interest. We used the projection-based thickness method to assess the cortical thickness and Desikan-Killiany atlas for cortical parcellation.
RESULTS: We observed the lowest cortical thickness, depth, and gyrification in the SZC, followed by CIP and the control groups. The differences were predominantly seen in frontal cortices, with limited parietal and temporal regions involvement. After False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrections and post-hoc analysis, SZC had reduced cortical thickness than HC in the middle and inferior frontal, right entorhinal, and left postcentral regions. Cortical thickness of SZC was also significantly lower than CIP in bilateral postcentral and right middle frontal regions. We found negative correlations (after FDR corrections) between the duration of cannabis use and cortical thickness in loci of parietal and occipital cortices.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggested cortical structural abnormalities in schizophrenia, in reference to healthy controls and cannabis-induced psychosis, indicating different pathophysiology of SZC and CIP.",Declaration of competing interest None of the authors of this manuscript report any Conflict of Interest.,"This research has been partially funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India.",Journal of Psychiatric Research,,,Brain; Cannabis; Cerebral Cortex; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Marijuana Abuse; Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia,2022-09-21,2022,2022-09-21,2022-11,155,,286-294,,,"Ghosh, Abhishek; Kaur, Simranjit; Shah, Raghav; Oomer, Fareed; Avasthi, Ajit; Ahuja, Chirag K; Basu, Debasish; Nehra, Ritu; Khandelwal, Niranjan","Ghosh, Abhishek (Drug De-addiction and Treatment Centre, Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 2-mT magnetic fields with various waveforms, including sinusoidal, triangular, and pulsed shapes, were employed to determine the biological effects of ELF-EMF on the human osteosarcoma MG-63 cell line. All experiments were performed in two modes: continuous exposure at 3 h and fractionated irradiations at 3 consecutive days. Afterward, the proliferation assay was implemented for assessing the cell proliferation in each group. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining and confocal imaging were performed to determine the cell shape index. Furthermore, fractal dimension analysis was carried out by processing morphological images.
Results: The proliferation and shape index parameters of radiation-induced osteosarcomas significantly decreased compared with non-irradiated cells. In addition, fractal dimensions significantly increased following fractionated exposure at 3 consecutive days.
Conclusions: Assessing the fractal dimensions can be considered as a new morphological index for the prognosis of the structural remodeling of human osteosarcoma cells in response to fractionated irradiation of ELF-MF. In addition, various waveforms induce a similar effect on morphological remodeling and cell proliferation.",,,Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics,,,Humans; Electromagnetic Fields; Magnetic Fields; Osteosarcoma; Cell Proliferation; Bone Neoplasms,2023-04-26,2023,2023-04-26,2023,19,5,1311-1315,,,"Shoorche, Amin Barati; Mohammadkarim, Alireza; Jadidi, Majid; Bahraminasab, Marjan; Bagheri, Hamed; Gholami, Somayeh","Shoorche, Amin Barati (Department of Medical Physics, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.); Mohammadkarim, Alireza (Department of Medical Physics, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.); Jadidi, Majid (Department of Medical Physics, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.); Bahraminasab, Marjan (Nervous System Stem Cells Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.); Bagheri, Hamed (Radiation Biology Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences; Radiation Sciences Research Center (RSRC), AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.); Gholami, Somayeh (Department of Radiation Oncology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA.)",,"Shoorche, Amin Barati (Semnan University of Medical Sciences); Mohammadkarim, Alireza (Semnan University of Medical Sciences); Jadidi, Majid (Semnan University of Medical Sciences); Bahraminasab, Marjan (Semnan University of Medical Sciences); Bagheri, Hamed (Iran University of Medical Sciences); Gholami, Somayeh (Virginia Commonwealth University)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_1848_21,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164265350,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,

The feasibility of this established numerical model is validated by the load-displacement curves and fracture morphology of shale in the laboratory test. The influences of the mass fraction, elastic modulus, and spatial distribution of clay minerals on the tensile strength and failure behaviors of shale are comprehensively analyzed using the developed numerical model. The results show that the clay content has the strongest influence on the tensile strength of shale. The number of matrix cracks is sensitive to the clay distribution, and the complexity of the matrix fracture network in shale shows a positive correlation with the clay content. In addition, the variation of the clay modulus has a linear correlation with the macro elastic modulus of shale.",The authors are grateful for the financial support from the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (ZR2020ME269 and ZR2021MD011) and the Start-up funding for doctoral research at Shandong University of Technology in 2021 (no. 421068).,,ACS Omega,,,,2022-07-06,2022,2022-07-06,2022-07-19,7,28,24219-24230,,,"Dou, Fakai; Hou, Peng; Jia, Zhirong; Wang, Chunguang; Zhao, Hongbo; Wang, Yanping","Dou, Fakai (School of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, 255000, China); Hou, Peng (IPPH, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907, United States); Jia, Zhirong (School of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, 255000, China); Wang, Chunguang (School of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, 255000, China); Zhao, Hongbo (School of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, 255000, China); Wang, Yanping (School of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, 255000, China)","Hou, Peng (Purdue University West Lafayette)","Dou, Fakai (Shandong University of Technology); Hou, Peng (Purdue University West Lafayette); Jia, Zhirong (Shandong University of Technology); Wang, Chunguang (Shandong University of Technology); Zhao, Hongbo (Shandong University of Technology); Wang, Yanping (Shandong University of Technology)",1,1,0.83,0.46,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9301711,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149274485,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

The purpose of this study was to use fractal analysis to assess alterations in the trabecular pattern of the mandibular condyle in patients with degenerative temporomandibular disorders. Materials and methods This study comprised 98 subjects with 49 subjects in the study group and 49 subjects in the control group, aged 18-50 years. Age and sex in the control group were matched to those in the case group. The subjects were assessed clinically with the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders. Digital panoramic X-ray equipment with set parameters of 70 kvp, 8 mA, and 16-second exposure duration was used to take panoramic radiographs. Fractal analysis was done and the calculated fractal dimension value was obtained using ImageJ version 1.48 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The same observer used Muir and Goss's method to rate the total degenerative changes in the condylar surfaces, which were substantiated by the calculated fractal dimension value. The data were statistically analyzed. Results The results revealed a significant difference (p-value = 0.041) between the mean fractal value in the case group's (1.35) and the control group's (1.38) left sides whereas the differences in the mean fractal values between the case and control groups on the right side was not significant (p-value = 0.49). Conclusion It is recommended to use the fractal dimension value and the total degenerative severity score together to quantify degenerative changes in the TMJ OA rather than exclusively relying on fractal value.",,,Cureus,,"Alexander Muacevic, John R Adler",,2024-04-02,2024,2024-04-02,,16,4,e57449,,,"Surenthar, Mouttoukichenin; Srinivasan, Subramanian V; Parimala, Djeapragassam; Ramanathan, Vineeth","Surenthar, Mouttoukichenin (Oral Medicine and Radiology, Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, Chennai, IND); Srinivasan, Subramanian V (Oral Medicine and Radiology, Mahatma Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Puducherry, IND); Parimala, Djeapragassam (Oral Medicine and Radiology, Mahatma Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Puducherry, IND); Ramanathan, Vineeth (Oral Medicine and Radiology, Private Practitioner, Dindigul, IND)","Surenthar, Mouttoukichenin (Saveetha Institute of Medical And Technical Sciences)","Surenthar, Mouttoukichenin (Saveetha Institute of Medical And Technical Sciences); Srinivasan, Subramanian V (Pondicherry University); Parimala, Djeapragassam (Pondicherry University); Ramanathan, Vineeth (Oral Medicine and Radiology, Private Practitioner, Dindigul, IND)",0,0,,,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/239283/20240402-10808-yhanr1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170393095,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

When mass function degenerates to probability, the fractal dimension is equivalent to classical Renyi information dimension only with α=1$$\alpha = 1$$, which can measure the change rate of Shannon entropy with the size of framework. For Renyi dimension, different parameters α$$\alpha $$ represent the relationship between different entropies and framework size. However, this compatibility is not shown in existing fractal dimension. Thus, in this paper, we introduce parameter α$$\alpha $$ to generalize the existing dimension. Due to the diversity of the value of α$$\alpha $$, we name the new dimension: multifractal dimension of mass function. In addition, inspired by multifractal spectrum of Cantor set, we explore the relation between the belief degree of focal element and the number of focal element with same belief degree for some special assignments. Relevant results are also presented by spectrum. We provide a static discounting coefficient generating method to modify mass function to improve the accuracy of classify result.

For this purpose, a rock mechanics testing system and an acoustic emission monitoring system were used to conduct acoustic emission positioning experiments on coal samples under uniaxial compression. According to clustering theory, the distribution pattern of microcracks and the dynamic evolution process of multiple cracks were studied. Subsequently, the reasons for the change in the spatio-temporal entropy (H) and fractal dimension (D) of a single crack were revealed. The research results show that microcracks present a statistical equilibrium distribution, the Gaussian distribution model is applicable to cluster crack distribution patterns, and a machine learning method can effectively identify cracks. The fractal dimension reflects the spatial characteristics of three-dimensional elliptical cracks, and low-dimensional cluster cracks are more likely to develop into macroscopic cracks. The change of H is related to the formation process of cracks, and an abnormal H (sudden increase and sudden decrease) could provide precursor information for the instability of coal samples. This research provides a new method to study crack distributions and formations and shows the competitiveness of the method in evaluating the damage state of coal.",This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2022YFC2903804) and Youth Science and Technology Innovation Fund of BGRIMM Technology Group (Grant No. 04-2228).,,Scientific Reports,,,,2023-10-20,2023,2023-10-20,,13,1,17961,,,"Chen, Zeng; Wang, Ping; Shi, Feng","Chen, Zeng (BGRIMM Technology Group, Building 23, Zone 18 of ABP, No. 188, South 4th Ring Road West, 100160, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; China-South Africa Joint Research Center for Development and Utilization on Mineral Resources, 102628, Beijing, People’s Republic of China); Wang, Ping (BGRIMM Technology Group, Building 23, Zone 18 of ABP, No. 188, South 4th Ring Road West, 100160, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; China-South Africa Joint Research Center for Development and Utilization on Mineral Resources, 102628, Beijing, People’s Republic of China); Shi, Feng (BGRIMM Technology Group, Building 23, Zone 18 of ABP, No. 188, South 4th Ring Road West, 100160, Beijing, People’s Republic of China; China-South Africa Joint Research Center for Development and Utilization on Mineral Resources, 102628, Beijing, People’s Republic of China)","Chen, Zeng (Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy; China-South Africa Joint Research Center for Development and Utilization on Mineral Resources, 102628, Beijing, People’s Republic of China)","Chen, Zeng (Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy; China-South Africa Joint Research Center for Development and Utilization on Mineral Resources, 102628, Beijing, People’s Republic of China); Wang, Ping (Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy; China-South Africa Joint Research Center for Development and Utilization on Mineral Resources, 102628, Beijing, People’s Republic of China); Shi, Feng (Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy; China-South Africa Joint Research Center for Development and Utilization on Mineral Resources, 102628, Beijing, People’s Republic of China)",1,1,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-45276-z.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165061266,37 Earth Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

The model is applied to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic from day 1 to day 699 from the beginning of the pandemic. The calculated parameters of the model accurately determine the parameters of the trend and the large jump in daily diseases in this time interval.

This study aims to assess the trabecular pattern of jaws via fractal analysis (FA) on initial panoramic radiographs (OPG) of the patients with LCH to facilitate interpretation of the radiographic changes.
METHODS: A case-control study investigated LCH cases with jaw involvement retrieved from the databases of Istanbul and Kocaeli Universities between 2010 and 2021. Initial OPGs of LCH cases and OPGs of healthy sex- and age-matched controls were investigated with FA. All images were assessed using ImageJ software. On each OPG, a total of 6 regions of interest (ROIs) located on the mandible were investigated bilaterally. The independent variables were the trabecular patterns of jaws of LCH cases and their control matches. The outcome variables were the fractal dimension (FD) values obtained from the ROIs on OPGs. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Student's t test.
RESULTS: Fifteen LCH-control pairs were investigated. In one ROI located in the supracortical area above the left mandibular angle, FD values of LCH cases (1.273 ± 112.8) were significantly lower than controls (1.308 ± 85.3; P < .05). Lower FD values were also calculated for some of the remaining ROIs, but there was no significant difference between groups (P > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Regarding our results, FA was not a useful parameter to discern radiographical trabecular changes between LCH cases and controls.

METHODS: The study retrospectively enrolled 104 participants with ESRD who underwent 3.0 T cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from June 2018 to November 2020. LV trabeculation was quantified with fractal analysis of short-axis cine slices to estimate the FD. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate FD and cardiac MRI parameters and to find independent risk predictors. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to investigate the association between FD and MACE.
RESULTS: LV FD was higher in in the HFpEF group than those in the non-HFpEF group, with the greatest difference near the base of the ventricle. Age, minimum left atrial volume index, and LV mean basal FD were independent predictors for HFpEF in patients with ESRD. Combining the mean basal FD with typical predictive factors resulted in a C-index (0.902 vs 0.921), which was not significantly higher. Same improvements were found for net reclassification improvement [0.642; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.254-1.029] and integrated discrimination index (0.026; 95% CI, 0.008-0.061). Participants with a LV global FD above the cutoff value (1.278) had higher risks of MACE in ESRD patients.

METHODS: Digital panoramic radiographs of 20 individuals with OI (case group) and 40 individuals without OI (control group) were examined. The RMIs of mandibular cortical index (MCI) and mandibular cortical thickness (MCT) were analyzed. FD of mandibular trabecular bone was calculated bilaterally in 3 regions. The chi-squared test and paired t test were used to compare the significance of differences between the groups. The effect size and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) were also determined. Significance was established at P < .05.
RESULTS: Categories C2 and C3 of the MCI were more frequent in individuals with OI (P < .001). The Mean MCT was 2.08 ± 0.79 in the OI case group and 2.91 ± 0.60 in the control group (P < .001). Mean FD in the condylar region was significantly lower in the OI case group (P = .002). The effect size for these 2 measures was large, and the difference between groups was greater than the MCID.
CONCLUSION: Radiographs of individuals with OI exhibited more porosity and diminished thickness of the mandibular cortical bone and lower FD values in the condylar trabecular bone.",Declaration of interest None.,This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico—Brasil (CNPq); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais—Brasil (FAPEMIG); and Pró-Reitoria de Pesquisa da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (PRPq/UFMG).,Oral Surgery Oral Medicine Oral Pathology and Oral Radiology,,,"Humans; Osteogenesis Imperfecta; Cross-Sectional Studies; Bone Density; Fractals; Radiography, Panoramic; Mandible",2023-02-12,2023,2023-02-12,2023-07,136,1,102-111,,,"Prado, Heloisa Vieira; Debossan, Suélen Alves Teixeira; Loayza, Katherine Silvana; Abreu, Lucas Guimarães; Brasileiro, Cláudia Borges; Borges-Oliveira, Ana Cristina","Prado, Heloisa Vieira (Department of Community and Preventive Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

We sought to investigate differences in structural complexity between healthy and affected territories of cerebral vasculature in moyamoya, as well as associated scalp vasculature and native transdural collaterals in patients with moyamoya by comparing their respective fractal dimensions.
METHODS: Our cohort consisted of 15 transdural collaterals from 12 patients with unilateral anterior circulation moyamoya. Frames of distal arterial vasculature from internal and external carotid angiograms were selected then automatically segmented and also manually annotated by a cerebrovascular surgeon. In the affected hemisphere, the region with transdural collateral supply was compared to the contralateral region. The resulting skeletonized angiograms were analyzed for their fractal dimensions.
RESULTS: We found the average fractal dimension (Df) of the moyamoya-side ICA was 1.82 with slightly different means for the anteroposterial (AP) and lateral views (mean  =  1.82; mean  =  1.81). The overall mean for healthy cerebral vasculature was also found to be 1.82 (AP: mean  =  1.83; lateral: mean  =  1.81). Mean Df of native transdural collaterals was found to be 1.82 (AP: mean  =  1.83; lateral: mean  =  1.81). The mean Df difference between autosegmented and manually segmented images was 0.013.
CONCLUSION: In accordance with the clinical understanding of moyamoya disease, the distal arterial structural complexity is not affected in moyamoya, and is maintained by transdural collaterals formed by vasculogenesis. Autosegmentation of cerebral vasculature is also shown to be accurate when compared to manual segmentation.",,,Interventional Neuroradiology,,,,2023-01-26,2023,2023-01-26,2023-01-26,,,15910199231152513,,,"Weber, Daniel S; Huang, Kevin T; See, Alfred P","Weber, Daniel S (Department of Neurosurgery, 1862Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.); Huang, Kevin T (Department of Neurosurgery, 1861Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.); See, Alfred P (Department of Neurosurgery, 1862Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.)",,"Weber, Daniel S (Harvard University); Huang, Kevin T (Harvard University); See, Alfred P (Harvard University)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154909084,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences,

Despite great research advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying the disease, its diagnosis, and its treatment, IPF still remains idiopathic without known biological or histological markers able to predict disease progression or response to treatment. The histologic hallmark of IPF is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), with its intricate architectural distortion and temporal inhomogeneity. We hypothesize that normal lung alveolar architecture can be compared to fractals, such as the Pythagoras tree with its fractal dimension (Df), and every pathological insult, distorting the normal lung structure, could result in Df variations. In this study, we aimed to assess the UIP histologic fractal dimension in relationship to other morphometric parameters in newly diagnosed IPF patients and its possible role in the prognostic stratification of the disease. Clinical data and lung tissue specimens were obtained from twelve patients with IPF, twelve patients with non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and age-matched ""healthy"" control lung tissue from patients undergoing lung surgery for other causes. Histology and histomorphometry were performed to evaluate Df and lacunarity measures, using the box counting method on the FracLac ImageJ plugin. The results showed that Df was significantly higher in IPF patients compared to controls and fibrotic NSIP patients, indicating greater architectural distortion in IPF. Additionally, high Df values were associated with higher fibroblastic foci density and worse prognostic outcomes in IPF, suggesting that Df may serve as a potential novel prognostic marker for IPF. The scalability of Df measurements was demonstrated through repeated measurements on smaller portions from the same surgical biopsies, which were selected to mimic a cryobiopsy. Our study provides further evidence to support the use of fractal morphometry as a tool for quantifying and determining lung tissue remodeling in IPF, and we demonstrated a significant correlation between histological and radiological Df in UIP pattern, as well as a significant association between Df and FF density. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the scalability and self-similarity of Df measurements across different biopsy types, including surgical and smaller specimens.",The authors acknowledge Matteo Tiracorrendo and Leonardo Teodonio for the active support in data retrieval.,This work was supported by: (1) Fondo di Ricerca di Ateneo 2022 (Grant No.: RM12218167B3A0D3 to C.

Previous work has hypothesized that the chaotic temporal nature of tics could possess an inherent fractality, that is, have neighbour-to-neighbour correlation at all levels of timescale. However, demonstrating this phenomenon has eluded researchers for more than two decades, primarily because of the challenges associated with estimating the scale-invariant, power law exponent-called the fractal dimension Df-from fractional Brownian noise. Here, we confirm this hypothesis and establish the fractality of tics by examining two tic time series datasets collected 6-12 months apart in children with tics, using random walk models and directional statistics. We find that Df is correlated with tic severity as measured by the YGTTS total tic score, and that Df is a sensitive parameter in examining the effect of several tic suppression conditions on the tic time series. Our findings pave the way for using the fractal nature of tics as a robust quantitative tool for estimating tic severity and treatment effectiveness, as well as a possible marker for differentiating typical from functional tics.","Funding for this study was provided by a McKelvey Collaboration Initiation Grant (CIG) and NIH grant nos.

Materials and methods: Seven dry male mandibles were selected, and a Gutta-Percha was used to identify identical regions of interest. A periapical radiograph was taken with 60 kVp/7 mA and exported in DICOM, JPEG, TIFF, and PNG formats. Nine periapical radiographs (60, 65, 70 kVp; 4, 5, 6 mA) were taken from seven dry human mandibles. Additionally, 12 panoramic radiographs (60, 70, 81, 90 kVp; 5, 8, 13 mA) and 10 CBCT images (with different scanning options and FOVs) were taken from each mandible. FDs were measured from a standard area.
Results: The intra-class correlation coefficient demonstrated a high degree of agreement between observers. No significant difference was found between TIFF and PNG formats (p > 0.05). The highest FD mean was found in TIFF format, while the lowest FD mean was found in JPEG format (p<0.001). There was no significant difference between kVp and mA settings in periapical images. In panoramic images, a significant difference was found at 90 kVp (p = 0.001) and 13 mA (p<0.001), with lower FD values observed at these settings. There was no significant difference between FOV and resolution in CBCT images (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: The format of the image can influence FD. For periapical and panoramic radiographs, kVp and mA settings do not have a significant impact on FD. However, fractal analysis may not be an ideal method for evaluating three-dimensional images, such as those obtained with CBCT.",,,European Oral Research,,,,2023-05-04,2023,2023-06-05,2023-05-04,57,2,68-74,,,"Amuk, Mehmet; Saribal, Gamze Sirin; Ersu, Nihal; Yilmaz, Serkan","Amuk, Mehmet (Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkiye); Saribal, Gamze Sirin (Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkiye); Ersu, Nihal (Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkiye); Yilmaz, Serkan (Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkiye)",,"Amuk, Mehmet (Erciyes University); Saribal, Gamze Sirin (Erciyes University); Ersu, Nihal (Erciyes University); Yilmaz, Serkan (Erciyes University)",1,1,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10387138,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158647509,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,

A predictive model for the degradation of the elastic modulus of Coal Gangue coarse aggregate Concrete (CGC), based on mesoscopic damage, was established to provide an interpretation of the macroscopic mechanical behavior of CGC after F-Ts damage at a mesoscopic scale. It was found that after F-Ts, the compressive strength of concrete, with coal gangue replacement rates of 30%, 60%, and 100%, respectively, decreased by 33.76%, 34.89%, and 42.05% compared with unfrozen specimens. The results indicate that an increase in the coal gangue replacement rate exacerbates the degradation of concrete performance during the F-Ts process. Furthermore, the established predictive formula for elastic modulus degradation closely matches the experimental data, offering a reliable theoretical basis for the durability design of CGC in F-Ts environments.",,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51774167), and 2022 Liaoning Provincial Department of Education Basic Research Project (General Project) (No. LJKMZ20220701).",Materials,,Miguel Ángel Sanjuán,,2024-02-20,2024,2024-02-20,,17,5,975,,,"Xin, Changhao; Yang, Yu; Yang, Mengze; Di, Junzhen; Sun, Yidan; Liang, Pengfei; Wang, Yaohong","Xin, Changhao (College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, 472120637@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (C.X.);, yangyu9300@163.com, (Y.Y.);, dijunzhen@126.com, (J.D.);, 472010038@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (P.L.)); Yang, Yu (College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, 472120637@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (C.X.);, yangyu9300@163.com, (Y.Y.);, dijunzhen@126.com, (J.D.);, 472010038@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (P.L.)); Yang, Mengze (College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, 472120637@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (C.X.);, yangyu9300@163.com, (Y.Y.);, dijunzhen@126.com, (J.D.);, 472010038@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (P.L.)); Di, Junzhen (College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, 472120637@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (C.X.);, yangyu9300@163.com, (Y.Y.);, dijunzhen@126.com, (J.D.);, 472010038@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (P.L.)); Sun, Yidan (College of Civil and Marine Engineering, Jiangsu Ocean University, Lianyungang 222000, China;, 2020000083@jou.edu.cn); Liang, Pengfei (College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, 472120637@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (C.X.);, yangyu9300@163.com, (Y.Y.);, dijunzhen@126.com, (J.D.);, 472010038@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (P.L.)); Wang, Yaohong (China Railway Fourth Bureau Group Road and Bridge Engineering Co., Ltd., Changchun 130000, China;, wangyaohong1@foxmail.com)","Yang, Mengze (Liaoning Technical University; College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, 472120637@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (C.X.);, yangyu9300@163.com, (Y.Y.);, dijunzhen@126.com, (J.D.);, 472010038@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (P.L.))","Xin, Changhao (Liaoning Technical University; College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, 472120637@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (C.X.);, yangyu9300@163.com, (Y.Y.);, dijunzhen@126.com, (J.D.);, 472010038@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (P.L.)); Yang, Yu (Liaoning Technical University; College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, 472120637@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (C.X.);, yangyu9300@163.com, (Y.Y.);, dijunzhen@126.com, (J.D.);, 472010038@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (P.L.)); Yang, Mengze (Liaoning Technical University; College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, 472120637@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (C.X.);, yangyu9300@163.com, (Y.Y.);, dijunzhen@126.com, (J.D.);, 472010038@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (P.L.)); Di, Junzhen (Liaoning Technical University; College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, 472120637@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (C.X.);, yangyu9300@163.com, (Y.Y.);, dijunzhen@126.com, (J.D.);, 472010038@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (P.L.)); Sun, Yidan (Jiangsu Ocean University); Liang, Pengfei (Liaoning Technical University; College of Civil Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin 123000, China;, 472120637@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (C.X.);, yangyu9300@163.com, (Y.Y.);, dijunzhen@126.com, (J.D.);, 472010038@stu.lntu.edu.cn, (P.L.)); Wang, Yaohong (China Railway Fourth Bureau Group Road and Bridge Engineering Co., Ltd., Changchun 130000, China;, wangyaohong1@foxmail.com)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/5/975/pdf?version=1708427819,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169077638,34 Chemical Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

Here, orthogonal experiments were carried out to evaluate the thermal insulation performance of fly ash geopolymer modified by phenolic resin, silica aerogel, and hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, variance analysis and range analysis were applied to estimate the influence of modifying agents on the thermal insulation performance of the geopolymer. The results demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of fly ash geopolymer significantly reduces (from 0.48 W/m·K to 0.12 W/m·K) due to the combined effect of the three modifying agents. Based on the variance analysis and range analysis, the optimum thermal conductivity ultimately reaches 0.08 W/m·K via a best composition scheme of the three modifying agents. Moreover, phenolic resin can facilitate the formation of a network structure and increase the porosity of micron pores (>1 μm). Hydrogen peroxide can be decomposed into O2 in an alkaline environment and leave large-diameter pores (>1 μm) during curing. Some silica aerogel is embedded in the geopolymer matrix as microspheres with extremely low thermal conductivity, whereas the rest of the silica aerogel may react with the alkali activator to form water, and subsequently leaves pores (>1 μm) after evaporation of water during the curing. In addition, a newly modified Maxwell-Euchen model using iterative calculation and considering the Knudsen effect (pores of micron or even nanometer scale) is proposed and validated by the experimental data. The foamed geopolymer in this research can be used as a reference for building insulation layer design. This research unravels phenolic resin-, silica aerogel-, and hydrogen peroxide-influenced thermal insulation mechanisms of geopolymer that may have impacts on deployment of a thermally insulating material in the construction field.","This research was supported by the Cultivation Funds of Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (KC21312), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42230704), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20221135), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2022M723400), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2022QN1038), and the Key R&amp;D Program of Jiangsu, China (BE2020038).","This research was funded by the Cultivation Funds of Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory grant number KC21312, the National Natural Science Foundation of China grant number 42230704, the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province grant number BK20221135, the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation grant number 2022M723400, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities grant number 2022QN1038, and the Key R&D Program of Jiangsu, China grant number BE2020038.",Polymers,,,,2023-07-30,2023,2023-07-30,,15,15,3254,,,"Ji, Yukun; Ren, Quanming; Li, Xiaozhao; Zhao, Peng; Vandeginste, Veerle","Ji, Yukun (State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China;, yukun.ji@cumt.edu.cn, (Y.J.);; Yunlong Lake Laboratory of Deep Earth Science and Engineering, Xuzhou 221116, China); Ren, Quanming (School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China); Li, Xiaozhao (State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China;, yukun.ji@cumt.edu.cn, (Y.J.);; Yunlong Lake Laboratory of Deep Earth Science and Engineering, Xuzhou 221116, China); Zhao, Peng (State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou 221116, China;, yukun.ji@cumt.edu.cn, (Y.J.);; Yunlong Lake Laboratory of Deep Earth Science and Engineering, Xuzhou 221116, China); Vandeginste, Veerle (Department Materials Engineering, KU Leuven Campus Bruges, B-8200 Bruges, Belgium)","Ren, Quanming (Nanjing University)","Ji, Yukun (China University of Mining and Technology; Yunlong Lake Laboratory of Deep Earth Science and Engineering, Xuzhou 221116, China); Ren, Quanming (Nanjing University); Li, Xiaozhao (China University of Mining and Technology; Yunlong Lake Laboratory of Deep Earth Science and Engineering, Xuzhou 221116, China); Zhao, Peng (China University of Mining and Technology; Yunlong Lake Laboratory of Deep Earth Science and Engineering, Xuzhou 221116, China); Vandeginste, Veerle (KU Leuven)",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/15/3254/pdf?version=1690784049,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162918849,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

They work by analyzing, as a function of time (Dynamic Light Scattering, DLS) or angles (Static Light Scattering, SLS), the light scattered by a sample, or measuring, as a function of the wavelength, the intensity scattered over the entire solid angle when the sample is illuminated with white light (Multi Wavelength Turbidimetry, MWT). Light scattering methods probe different length scales, in the ranges of ~5−500 nm (DLS), or ~0.1−5 μm (Wide Angle SLS), or ~1−100 μm (Low Angle SLS), and some of them can be operated in a time-resolved mode, with the possibility of characterizing not only stationary, but also aggregating, polymerizing, or self-assembling samples. Thus, the combined use of these techniques represents a powerful approach for studying systems characterized by very different length scales. In this work, we will review some typical applications of these methods, ranging from the field of colloidal fractal aggregation to the polymerization of biologic networks made of randomly entangled nanosized fibers. We will also discuss the opportunity of combining together different scattering techniques, emphasizing the advantages of a global analysis with respect to single-methods data processing.",We thank Gabriele Re Calegari for collaborating on the early development of the LA-SLS + MWT instrument and Francesco Cavalleri for helping with the colloidal aggregation data.

In this context, this work presents a method for structuring carbon black aggregates by adding colloidal silica via a spray flame with the goal of opening up more choices for polymeric binders. The main focus of this research lies in the multiscale characterization of the aggregate properties via small-angle X-ray scattering, analytical disc centrifugation and electron microscopy. The results show successful formation of sinter-bridges between silica and carbon black leading to an increase in hydrodynamic aggregate diameter from 201 nm to up to 357 nm, with no significant changes in primary particle properties. However, segregation and coalescence of silica particles was identified for higher mass ratios of silica to carbon black, resulting in a reduction in the homogeneity of the hetero-aggregates. This effect was particularly evident for silica particles with larger diameters of 60 nm. Consequently, optimal conditions for hetero-aggregation were identified at mass ratios below 1 and particle sizes around 10 nm, at which homogenous distributions of silica within the carbon black structure were achieved. The results emphasise the general applicability of hetero-aggregation via spray flames with possible applications as battery materials.","We would like to thank H.

The research performed in this paper was focused on detecting and analyzing dyslexic tendencies in Serbian children based on eye-tracking measures. The group of 30 children (ages 7-13, 15 dyslexic and 15 non-dyslexic) read 13 different text segments on 13 different color configurations. For each text segment, the corresponding eye-tracking trail was recorded and then processed offline and represented by nine conventional features and five newly proposed features. The features were used for dyslexia recognition using several machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest. The highest accuracy of 94% was achieved using all the implemented features and leave-one-out subject cross-validation. Afterwards, the most important features for dyslexia detection (representing the complexity of fixation gaze) were used in a statistical analysis of the individual color effects on dyslexic tendencies within the dyslexic group. The statistical analysis has shown that the influence of color has high inter-subject variability. This paper is the first to introduce features that provide clear separability between a dyslexic and control group in the Serbian language (a language with a shallow orthographic system). Furthermore, the proposed features could be used for diagnosing and tracking dyslexia as biomarkers for objective quantification.",,"This research was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology Development of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia (contracts 451-03-68/2022-14/200103 and 451-03-68/2022-14/200223).",Sensors,,,"Child; Dyslexia; Eye-Tracking Technology; Humans; Language; Reading; Recognition, Psychology",2022-06-29,2022,2022-06-29,,22,13,4900,,,"Vajs, Ivan; Ković, Vanja; Papić, Tamara; Savić, Andrej M.; Janković, Milica M.","Vajs, Ivan (School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, 11120 Belgrade, Serbia;, andrej_savic@etf.rs, (A.M.S.);, piperski@etf.rs, (M.M.J.); Innovation Center, School of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade, Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra 73, 11120 Belgrade, Serbia); Ković, Vanja (Faculty of Philosophy, University of Belgrade, Čika-Ljubina 18-20, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia;, vanja.kovic@f.bg.ac.rs); Papić, Tamara (Faculty of Technical Sciences, University Singidunum, Danijelova 32, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia;, tpapic@singidunum.ac.rs); Savić, Andrej M.

We have continued to develop Complexity and Entropy in Physiological Signals (CEPS) as an open access MATLAB® GUI (graphical user interface) providing multiple methods for the modification and analysis of physiological data.
METHODS: To demonstrate the functionality of the software, data were collected from 44 healthy adults for a study investigating the effects on vagal tone of breathing paced at five different rates, as well as self-paced and un-paced. Five-minute 15-s recordings were used. Results were also compared with those from shorter segments of the data. Electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA) and Respiration (RSP) data were recorded. Particular attention was paid to COVID risk mitigation, and to parameter tuning for the CEPS measures. For comparison, data were processed using Kubios HRV, RR-APET and DynamicalSystems.jl software. We also compared findings for ECG RR interval (RRi) data resampled at 4 Hz (4R) or 10 Hz (10R), and non-resampled (noR). In total, we used around 190-220 measures from CEPS at various scales, depending on the analysis undertaken, with our investigation focused on three families of measures: 22 fractal dimension (FD) measures, 40 heart rate asymmetries or measures derived from Poincaré plots (HRA), and 8 measures based on permutation entropy (PE).
RESULTS: FDs for the RRi data differentiated strongly between breathing rates, whether data were resampled or not, increasing between 5 and 7 breaths per minute (BrPM). Largest effect sizes for RRi (4R and noR) differentiation between breathing rates were found for the PE-based measures. Measures that both differentiated well between breathing rates and were consistent across different RRi data lengths (1-5 min) included five PE-based (noR) and three FDs (4R). Of the top 12 measures with short-data values consistently within ± 5% of their values for the 5-min data, five were FDs, one was PE-based, and none were HRAs. Effect sizes were usually greater for CEPS measures than for those implemented in DynamicalSystems.jl.
CONCLUSION: The updated CEPS software enables visualisation and analysis of multichannel physiological data using a variety of established and recently introduced complexity entropy measures. Although equal resampling is theoretically important for FD estimation, it appears that FD measures may also be usefully applied to non-resampled data.","Firstly: we would like to thank our study participants, who generously gave up their time during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A four-parameter, fractal universal Langmuir equation is a good fit to the data at low pressures. Standard Gibbs energy changes calculated from equilibrium adsorption coefficients show a series of broad peaks that indicate adsorbate structural transformations as a function of pressure and coverage. The Freundlich equation or mean fractal model is also a good fit to isotherms at low pressures. Pressure-varying fractals are accurate fits to the data. Fractal exponents provide information on adsorbate coverage and surface access. Broad peaks in pressure-varying exponents are indicators of adsorbate structure. From adsorptive gas amounts, mean and pressure-varying fractal exponents provide details of adsorbate fractal dimensions and surface roughness. Both Ar and N2 adsorption cause increases in mean surface roughness when compared with pure silica. Surface roughness fluctuations from pressure-dependent adsorptive gas fractal dimensions are associated with adsorbate structure. At one trough, the surface is smooth and is linked to close-packed Ar or N2. For Ar adsorption at 87 K, this structure is a complete monolayer (1.00(4)), while for Ar (77 K), 1.15(4) layers and for N2 (87 K), 2.02(10) layers. The universal Langmuir specific area of the silica is 10.1(4) m2 g-1. Pressure- and coverage-dependent adsorbate structures range from filling defects and holes on the surface to cluster formation to adsorbed Ar or N2 evenly distributed or packed across the surface. The Ar (87 K) isotherm is most sensitive to adsorbate structural transformations.","The authors thank Professor David Miron, University of New England, for the suggestion to use FLS and for other computational advice.",,Langmuir,,,,2023-01-23,2023,2023-01-23,2023-02-07,39,5,1914-1926,,,"Brown, Trevor C.; Bagheri, Ali; Fellows, Christopher M.","Brown, Trevor C.

The results indicate that both CSWs and BFs can increase the compressive strength of concrete. CSWs can enhance the dynamic modulus of elasticity of concrete, while the effect of BFs on the dynamic modulus of elasticity is not significant. The improvement in compressive strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity provided by MCSWs is significantly greater than that provided by CSWs. Both CSWs and BFs can effectively improve the pore structure of concrete and have a significant impact on the surface fractal dimension. CSWs inhibit the formation of ink-bottle pores, while BFs increase the number of ink-bottle pores. Due to the ink-bottle pore effect, the fractal dimension of the capillary pore surface is generally greater than three, lacking fractal characteristics. The compressive strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity of concrete have a good correlation with the fractal dimensions of large pores and transition pores.",The authors acknowledge and appreciate support received from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province.,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52079124, 52008317 and 51279181), the Research Fund for the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LY19E90006 and LQ20E080024), the special projects supported by Zhejiang provincial scientific research institutes of Zhejiang Institute of Hydraulics and Estuary (ZIHEYS22002) and the science and technology association of Wenzhou city (2019KXCX-KT).",Materials,,,,2024-04-08,2024,2024-04-08,,17,7,1706,,,"Zhang, Junzhi; Wang, Yueming; Li, Xixi; Zhang, Yurong; Wu, Lingjie","Zhang, Junzhi (College of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China;, jzzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, 2112106057@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.W.);, 221122060130@zjut.edu.cn, (X.L.);, yrzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.Z.); Key Laboratory of Civil Engineering Structure & Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Technology of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310014, China); Wang, Yueming (College of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China;, jzzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, 2112106057@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.W.);, 221122060130@zjut.edu.cn, (X.L.);, yrzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.Z.)); Li, Xixi (College of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China;, jzzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, 2112106057@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.W.);, 221122060130@zjut.edu.cn, (X.L.);, yrzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.Z.)); Zhang, Yurong (College of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China;, jzzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, 2112106057@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.W.);, 221122060130@zjut.edu.cn, (X.L.);, yrzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.Z.); Key Laboratory of Civil Engineering Structure & Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Technology of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310014, China); Wu, Lingjie (College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou 325035, China; Key Laboratory of Engineering and Technology for Soft Soil Foundation and Tideland Reclamation of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou 325035, China)","Wu, Lingjie (Wenzhou University; Key Laboratory of Engineering and Technology for Soft Soil Foundation and Tideland Reclamation of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou 325035, China)","Zhang, Junzhi (Zhejiang University of Technology; College of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China;, jzzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, 2112106057@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.W.);, 221122060130@zjut.edu.cn, (X.L.);, yrzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.Z.); Key Laboratory of Civil Engineering Structure & Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Technology of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310014, China); Wang, Yueming (Zhejiang University of Technology; College of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China;, jzzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, 2112106057@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.W.);, 221122060130@zjut.edu.cn, (X.L.);, yrzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.Z.)); Li, Xixi (Zhejiang University of Technology; College of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China;, jzzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, 2112106057@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.W.);, 221122060130@zjut.edu.cn, (X.L.);, yrzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.Z.)); Zhang, Yurong (Zhejiang University of Technology; College of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China;, jzzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (J.Z.);, 2112106057@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.W.);, 221122060130@zjut.edu.cn, (X.L.);, yrzhang@zjut.edu.cn, (Y.Z.); Key Laboratory of Civil Engineering Structure & Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Technology of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310014, China); Wu, Lingjie (Wenzhou University; Key Laboratory of Engineering and Technology for Soft Soil Foundation and Tideland Reclamation of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou 325035, China)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/7/1706/pdf?version=1712587337,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170548529,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

However, several different techniques are commonly utilized for studying fibrin structures, and comparison of results obtained using different techniques can be challenging due to lack of standardization.
Objectives: This study provides a path toward standardization by comparing fibrin fiber diameters for a range of physiologic fibrinogen and thrombin concentrations using multiple different complementary experimental methods.
Methods: We determined fiber diameter using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), superresolution (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy) fluorescence microscopy, and 4 commonly utilized turbidimetric approaches to determine the congruence between the results and the conditions under which each should be used.
Results: We found that diameter values obtained using SEM and superresolution imaging agree within 10% for nearly all conditions tested. We also found that when a wavelength range of 500 to 800 nm was used for measurements and accounting for the wavelength dependence of the refractive index and specific refractive index increment, diameters obtained using the corrected Yeromonahos turbidimetric approach agree with SEM within 20% for most conditions.
Conclusion: We performed a systematic, multitechnique survey assessing fibrin fiber diameters under a range of biochemical conditions. The similarity in the diameter values obtained using SEM and superresolution imaging suggests that drying and fixation during SEM sample preparation do not dramatically alter fiber cross-sections. Congruence, under certain conditions, between diameter values obtained using SEM, superresolution fluorescence imaging, and turbidimetry demonstrates the feasibility of a fibrin diameter standardization project.","Acknowledgments The authors thank B.

To reveal the influence regulation of primary fractures and the bedding angle of coal on its failure and provide theoretical basis for CBM development, raw coal samples of no 16 coal seam in Wenjiaba Coal Mine, Zhijin County, Bijie City with different bedding angles were selected as the research object, and uniaxial compression tests were carried out on them, and CT scanning and crack reconstruction before and after sample failure were carried out. The results show that (1) the compressive strength, elastic modulus, and Poisson's ratio of coal show a strong bedding angle effect, and the changing trend of each index is basically the same. The coal samples with bedding angles of 0 and 90° are the highest, while the coal samples with bedding angles of 30° are the lowest, and the overall distribution is an approximate ""U"" with the increase in bedding angle. With the increase in bedding angle of 0-90°, the failure modes of coal samples are tension-shear combined failure, shear-slip failure, and splitting tension failure in turn. (2) The observation of raw coal and CT scanning show that the primary cracks in coal samples are well developed, especially in the lower part of 0° samples, the cracks in 30° samples, 60° samples, and 90° samples are evenly distributed and develop at a certain angle with the weak bedding surface, and microcracks parallel to and nearly perpendicular to the weak bedding surface are developed in 45° samples. At the same time, banded minerals in coal and rock samples are also well developed. (3) The characteristics of crack propagation and evolution in coal samples with different bedding dip angles are significantly different. The bedding dip angles and primary cracks of coal seam have a great influence on crack propagation. With different bedding angles, the propagation modes are different. The crack propagation mainly includes two ways: forming a certain angle with bedding and extending along the bedding plane. (4) The fracture characteristic parameters of coal in the primary state and after failure have the same law with the bedding dip angle, showing a trend of high at both ends and low in the middle, which is an irregular ""U""-shaped distribution and has a similar law with mechanical characteristic parameters.","The authors thank the Geological Exploration Fund Project of Guizhou Province no: 52000021MGQSE7S7K6PRP, 208-9912-JBN-UTS0, the Chongqing Outstanding Young Talents (grant no CQYC202005019), and the Graduate Research and Innovation Foundation of Chongqing, China (grant no CYB20023), and this work supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under grant 52074046, 51834003.",,ACS Omega,,,,2022-07-29,2022,2022-07-29,2022-08-09,7,31,27185-27195,,,"Yuan, Tao; Wei, Yuanlong; Chen, Shiwan; Liu, Wei; Zhao, Lingyun; Zhang, Xiong","Yuan, Tao (College of Resources and Environment Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China); Wei, Yuanlong (Key Laboratory of Unconventional Natural Gas Evaluation and Development in Complex Tectonic Areas, Ministry of Natural Resources, Guiyang, 550081, China; Guizhou Engineering Research Institute of Oil & Gas Exploration and Development, Guiyang, 550081, China); Chen, Shiwan (College of Resources and Environment Engineering, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China); Liu, Wei (State Key Laboratory of Coal Mine Disaster Dynamics and Control, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China); Zhao, Lingyun (Key Laboratory of Unconventional Natural Gas Evaluation and Development in Complex Tectonic Areas, Ministry of Natural Resources, Guiyang, 550081, China; Guizhou Engineering Research Institute of Oil & Gas Exploration and Development, Guiyang, 550081, China); Zhang, Xiong (State Key Laboratory of Coal Mine Disaster Dynamics and Control, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China)","Wei, Yuanlong (Ministry of Natural Resources; Guizhou Engineering Research Institute of Oil & Gas Exploration and Development, Guiyang, 550081, China); Liu, Wei (Chongqing University)","Yuan, Tao (Guizhou University); Wei, Yuanlong (Ministry of Natural Resources; Guizhou Engineering Research Institute of Oil & Gas Exploration and Development, Guiyang, 550081, China); Chen, Shiwan (Guizhou University); Liu, Wei (Chongqing University); Zhao, Lingyun (Ministry of Natural Resources; Guizhou Engineering Research Institute of Oil & Gas Exploration and Development, Guiyang, 550081, China); Zhang, Xiong (Chongqing University)",3,3,,1.38,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9366991,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149850427,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,

In this study, we used landscape design to reconstruct an optimized ecological polder wetland and a lake wetland in the Yunmeng Marsh area, China, and the alternative stable states of the two wetland ecosystems were assessed from an ecosystem perspective via emergy/eco-exergy and fractal dimensions. The emergy densities for the optimized ecological polder wetland and the lake wetland were 2.35E+13 sej yr-1 m-3 and 2.18E+13 sej m-3, and the emergy sustainability index (ESI) values were 216.57 and 193.31, respectively, indicating that the reconstructed wetland ecosystems were dominated by renewable energy flows and were highly sustainable. The eco-exergy density and emergy/eco-exergy ratio results showed that natural selection self-organized the reconstructed wetland ecosystems to tolerate environmental stresses and changes. In addition, the fractal dimensions of the morphology and contour of the polder wetland, which reflect the space occupation capacity of geometric and physical constraints in the wetland, were 1.57 and 1.75, and those of the lake wetland were 1.03 and 1.47, respectively. The synthetic evaluation results showed that the alternative stable states of both the optimized ecological polder wetland ecosystem and the lake wetland ecosystem were ecofriendly modes of wetland reconstruction, which can be implemented together to create a ""lake-polder"" ecosystem.

However, it remains unclear to what extent the structural reorganization is affected by preexisting syntax-related networks. We examined 28 patients with a diffuse glioma in the left hemisphere and 23 healthy participants. Syntactic abilities were assessed by a picture-sentence matching task with various sentence types. The lesion responsible for agrammatic comprehension was identified by region-of-interest-based lesion-symptom mapping (RLSM). Cortical structural alterations were examined by surface-based morphometry (SBM), in which the cortical thickness and fractal dimension were measured with three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fiber tracking on the human population-averaged diffusion MRI template was performed to examine whether the cortical structural alterations were associated with the syntax-related networks. The RLSM revealed associations between agrammatic comprehension and a glioma in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule. The SBM demonstrated that decreased cortical thickness and/or increased complexity of the right posterior insula were associated not only with agrammatic comprehension of the patients but also with the syntactic abilities of healthy participants. The fiber tracking revealed that the route between these two regions was anatomically integrated into the preexisting syntax-related networks previously identified. These results suggest a potential association between agrammatic comprehension in patients with diffuse glioma and structural variations in specific tracts and cortical regions, which may be closely related to the syntax-related networks.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Yet, currently available methods are poorly suited to replicate the morphological and topological heterogeneity of real microvascular trees because the parameters used to control tree generation are too simplistic to mimic results of the complex angiogenetic and structural adaptation processes in vivo.
METHODS: We propose a method to overcome this limitation by integrating a conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (cDCGAN) with a local fractal dimension-oriented constrained constructive optimization (LFDO-CCO) strategy. The cDCGAN learns the patterns of real microvascular bifurcations allowing for their artificial replication. The LFDO-CCO strategy connects the generated bifurcations hierarchically to form microvascular trees with a vessel density corresponding to that observed in healthy tissues.
RESULTS: The generated artificial microvascular trees are consistent with real microvascular trees regarding characteristics such as fractal dimension, vascular density, and coefficient of variation of diameter, length, and tortuosity.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the adoption of the proposed strategy for the generation of artificial microvascular trees in tissue engineering as well as for computational modeling and simulations of microcirculatory physiology.","Acknowledgments This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 32371372, 31870938, and 81871454), the Zhejiang Province Key Research &amp; Development Program (No. 2020C03073), and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)—SFB—147, subproject A04.","Funding: This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 32371372, 31870938, and 81871454), the Zhejiang Province Key Research & Development Program (No. 2020C03073), and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation, SFB‐147, subproject A04).",Microcirculation,,,,2024-05-01,2024,2024-05,2024-05-01,,,e12854,,,"Pan, Qing; Shen, Huanghui; Li, Peilun; Lai, Biyun; Jiang, Akang; Huang, Wenjie; Lu, Fei; Peng, Hong; Fang, Luping; Kuebler, Wolfgang M.; Pries, Axel R.; Ning, Gangmin","Pan, Qing (College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China); Shen, Huanghui (College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China); Li, Peilun (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of MOE, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China); Lai, Biyun (College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China); Jiang, Akang (College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China); Huang, Wenjie (College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China); Lu, Fei (College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China); Peng, Hong (College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China); Fang, Luping (College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China); Kuebler, Wolfgang M.

The bound water of sludge and pore clogging in the process of pressure filtration dewatering are two key factors influencing the deep-dewatering effect of municipal sludge. The results of this study suggest that microwave irradiation (MI) can be used to synchronously evaporate water, reduce the bound water of sludge and solve the blockage of sludge pore channels during the process filtration dewatering, which can greatly reduce the moisture content of municipal sludge. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance, carbon dioxide gas absorption and desorption, and scanning electron microscope were synthetically used to detect the pore structure of sludge cakes. Thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry was used to detect binding energy to calculate moisture distribution. Thermal mechanism was revealed by dielectric constant, thermal conductivity, fractal dimensions, water saturation and porosity in different layers of sludge cake. The results showed that the bound water in sludge samples after MI was reduced by 19.4%, the pore fractal dimension was reduced from 2.955 to 2.867, the surface fractal dimension increased from 2.099 to 2.362 with the conditions of microwave power (700 w) and treat time (5 min). When the water saturation was close to 1, the dielectric constant of middle and outer layers was the main factor of heating, while the water saturation was close to 0, the main factor became the difference of thermal conductivity in middle and outer layers. Moreover, after MI, moisture content of sludge was greatly reduced from 68.4% to 40.1% for its thermal effect, further reduced to 34.1% by the continuous mechanical dewatering for its non-thermal effect which change the pore structure and moisture distribution. These conclusions are helpful to understand microwave thermal and non-thermal mechanism and shed light on new dewatering-drying integrated techniques of municipal sludge.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from Science and technology innovation leading talent project of special support plan for high-level talents of Zhejiang Province (201R52056) , the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 51878635 and 51876196), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation (grant numbers LR19E060001), Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang (2020YW02, 2020YW13), Public Welfare Technology Key Projects of Huzhou City (2018GZ26).",,Water Research,,,"Humans; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Microwaves; Water; Myocardial Infarction",2022-10-10,2022,2022-10-10,2022-11,226,,119231,,,"Rao, Binqi; Su, Jiangge; Xu, Shengjun; Pang, Hongru; Xu, Peng; Zhang, Yan; Zhu, Jianwei; Tu, Houde","Rao, Binqi (College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, PR China.

STUDY DESIGN: Ninety postmenopausal women over the age of 50 were included in this study. Trabecular bone density was specified numerically by fractal dimension (FD) in the region of interest selected on the panoramic radiograph. The width of the mandibular cortical (MCW) bone under the mental foramen of the mandible was measured. Mann-Whitney U test was used for parameters that did not show a normal distribution. Spearman rho correlation test was used to determine the relationship between continuous measurement parameters.
RESULTS: It was observed that FD and MCW of dentate and edentate individuals using bisphosphonate were statistically significantly lower than those of healthy individuals (P < .05). There was no significant correlation was found between the duration of use of bisphosphonates and the fractal values obtained from the relevant regions of the mandible (P > .05).
CONCLUSION: Fractal dimension was found to be lower in oral bisphosphonate use than in intravenous bisphosphonate use. The width of the mandibular cortical bone values was found to be lower in individuals using bisphosphonate than in healthy individuals. Fractal dimension and MCW may benefit clinicians as quantitative parameters in panoramic radiography in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.","Acknowledgment The authors thank the patients, faculty, staff, and students in the Inonu University Faculty of Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic for their participation in this study.

3231,pub.1166679462,10.1002/mds.29678,38054573,,Brain Dynamics Complexity as a Signature of Cognitive Decline in Parkinson's Disease,"BACKGROUND: Higuchi's fractal dimension (FD) captures brain dynamics complexity and may be a promising method to analyze resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and detect the neuronal interaction complexity underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to compare FD with a more established index of spontaneous neural activity, the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and identify through machine learning (ML) models which method could best distinguish across PD-cognitive states, ranging from normal cognition (PD-NC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) to dementia (PDD). Finally, the aim was to explore correlations between fALFF and FD with clinical and cognitive PD features.
METHODS: Among 118 PD patients age-, sex-, and education matched with 35 healthy controls, 52 were classified with PD-NC, 46 with PD-MCI, and 20 with PDD based on an extensive cognitive and clinical evaluation. fALFF and FD metrics were computed on rs-fMRI data and used to train ML models.
RESULTS: FD outperformed fALFF metrics in differentiating between PD-cognitive states, reaching an overall accuracy of 78% (vs. 62%). PD showed increased neuronal dynamics complexity within the sensorimotor network, central executive network (CEN), and default mode network (DMN), paralleled by a reduction in spontaneous neuronal activity within the CEN and DMN, whose increased complexity was strongly linked to the presence of dementia. Further, we found that some DMN critical hubs correlated with worse cognitive performance and disease severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that PD-cognitive decline is characterized by an altered spontaneous neuronal activity and increased temporal complexity, involving the CEN and DMN, possibly reflecting an increased segregation of these networks. Therefore, we propose FD as a prognostic biomarker of PD-cognitive decline. © 2023 The Authors.

Methods: In this cross-sectional and observational study, 138 eyes of 138 participants were examined. Indices of the microcirculation measured by OCTA included mean vessel density (VD), skeleton density (SD), vessel diameter index (VDI), fractal dimension (FD) and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) of the superficial retinal layer (SRL) and deep retinal layer (DRL), and peripapillary vessel caliber. The correlation of these indices with the carotid atherosclerotic lesions including carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and common carotid artery (CCA) plaque was assessed. Results: A total of 72 of 138 eyes demonstrated an increased (≥1 mm) CIMT, and 32 of the eyes presented common carotid plaques. Macular VD, SD, and FD were decreased with the increasing CCA caliber diameter (p < 0.05, respectively). Superficial and deep macular FDs were negatively associated with CIMT as well as the existence of CCA plaques (p < 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: Changes in retinal microvasculature accessed by OCTA may be used as one of the non-invasive early indicators to monitor asymptomatic CAS.",The authors express their sincere gratitude to the patients who participated in the trial.,This study was supported by the Tai’an Science and Technology Development Plan (grant number 2019NS175).,Frontiers in Physiology,,,,2022-06-03,2022,2022-06-03,,13,,824646,,,"Xu, Qian; Sun, Hongyi; Yi, Qu","Xu, Qian (Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China; Tai’an City Central Hospital, Tai’an, China); Sun, Hongyi (Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China); Yi, Qu (Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China)","Yi, Qu (Qilu Hospital of Shandong University)","Xu, Qian (Qilu Hospital of Shandong University; Taian City Central Hospital); Sun, Hongyi (Qilu Hospital of Shandong University); Yi, Qu (Qilu Hospital of Shandong University)",7,7,0.88,6.16,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.824646/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148403670,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,

As one of the main bearing structures of the surrounding rock, the stability of the roadway-side support body is a key factor for the success of gob-side entry retaining. In order to study the deformation characteristics and instability mechanism of roadway-side support body, based on the roadway-side support materials of gob-side entry retaining, the dynamic expansion test of back-filling concrete cracks under uniaxial compression was carried out. The YOLOv5 algorithm was applied to establish the fine identification and quantitative characterization method of macroscopic cracks of the samples, and the dynamic expansion rule of roadway-side support body cracks and its dimensional effect were revealed by combining the fractal theory. The results show that the F1 value and average precision mean of the intelligent dynamic crack identification model reached 75% and 71%, respectively, the GIoU loss value tends to fit around 0.038, and the model reached the overall optimal solution. During the uniaxial compression process, micro cracks on the surface of the back-filling concrete first initiated at the end, and after reaching the yield stress, the macroscopic cracks developed significantly. Moreover, several secondary cracks expanded, pooled, and connected from the middle of the specimen to the two ends, inducing the overall instability of the specimen. The surface crack expansion rate, density, and fractal dimension all show stage change characteristics with the increase in stress, and the main crack expansion rate has obvious precursor characteristics. With the increase in the size, the decrease in crack density after back-filling concrete failures gradually decreases from 93.19% to 4.08%, the surface crack network develops from complex to simple, and the failure mode transits from tensile failure to shear failure. The above research results provide a basic experimental basis for design optimization and instability prediction of a roadway-side support body for engineering-scale applications.",,"This research was funded by the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (Program No. 2021JLM-10), Shaanxi Provincial Outstanding Youth Science Foundation Project (2023-JC-JQ-42), and The Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities.

This study investigates the freeze-thaw damage mechanism of Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) asphalt mixtures containing reinforcement fibers, specifically basalt fiber as well as lignocellulosic fiber, through a microscopic void characteristics analysis. This investigation aims to understand how the presence of basalt fiber as well as lignocellulosic fiber influences void characteristics for SBS asphalt mixtures during freeze-thaw cycles. A comprehensive experimental program was conducted for the void and mechanical characteristics, which involved the preparation of SBS asphalt mixtures containing basalt fiber as well as lignocellulosic fiber. The mechanical performances of the two types of asphalt mixtures decrease with more freeze-thaw cycles. The decline is faster initially and gradually slows down. Basalt-fiber-modified SMA-13 has higher air void content and mechanical properties compared to lignocellulosic-fiber-modified SMA-13, indicating that adding basalt fibers improves the mechanical performances of SMA-13 asphalt mixture. Both types of asphalt mixtures experience increasing damage with more freeze-thaw cycles, indicating irreversible damage. The stability damage levels are similar, but basalt-fiber-modified SMA-13 has lower splitting strength damage and stiffness modulus damage compared to lignocellulosic-fiber-modified SMA-13. This suggests that adding basalt fibers enhances the resistance to freeze-thaw damage. Surface wear of asphalt mixtures under repeated freeze-thaw cycles is a complex and dynamic process. Fractal theory can uncover the mechanism of surface wear, while describing surface wear behavior and void deformation characteristics using fractal dimension, angularity, roundness, and aspect ratio is a logical and effective approach. The findings provide insights into freeze-thaw damage mechanisms at the microscopic level, highlighting the effects of reinforcement fibers. They provide valuable insights that can be used to optimize the design and maintenance of asphalt pavements.",,"This research was funded by the Scientific Research Project of the Department of Education of Jilin Province (grant number: JJKH20221019KJ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the Postdoctoral Researcher Selection Funding Project of Jilin Province, and Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Fund of Jilin University (grant number: S202310183289).",Polymers,,,,2023-09-26,2023,2023-09-26,,15,19,3887,,,"Wang, Wensheng; Yang, Liansheng; Cui, Honghai; Wu, Fei; Cheng, Yongchun; Liang, Chunyu","Wang, Wensheng (College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.)); Yang, Liansheng (College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.)); Cui, Honghai (Jilin Traffic Planning and Design Institute, Changchun 130021, China;, cuihh23@outlook.com); Wu, Fei (College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.)); Cheng, Yongchun (College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.)); Liang, Chunyu (College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.))","Wang, Wensheng (Jilin University; College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.)); Liang, Chunyu (Jilin University; College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.))","Wang, Wensheng (Jilin University; College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.)); Yang, Liansheng (Jilin University; College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.)); Cui, Honghai (Jilin Traffic Planning and Design Institute, Changchun 130021, China;, cuihh23@outlook.com); Wu, Fei (Jilin University; College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.)); Cheng, Yongchun (Jilin University; College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.)); Liang, Chunyu (Jilin University; College of Transportation, Jilin University, Changchun 130025, China;, yangls1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (L.Y.);, wufei1719@mails.jlu.edu.cn, (F.W.);, chengyc@jlu.edu.cn, (Y.C.))",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/19/3887/pdf?version=1695722965,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164436376,40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

The method was developed based on the information obtained from our investigation on the saliva samples of 170 pregnant women about the correlation of the salivary crystal pattern with pregnant age and fetal status. It demonstrated that the patterns of salivary crystallization could act as indicators of the pregnant age, fetal state, and some medical conditions of pregnant women. On this basis, with the aid of AI recognition and analysis of the fractal dimension and some characteristic crystals in the salivary crystallization, we performed estimation on the delivery date in both quantitative and qualitative manners. The accuracy of the prediction on 15 pregnant women was satisfactory: 100% delivering in the predicted week, 93.3% within the estimated three days, and 86.7% on the day as the prediction. We also developed a simple smartphone-based AI-aided salivary crystal imaging and analysis device as an auxiliary means to let pregnant women monitor their fetal status daily at home and predict their delivery date with adequate accuracy.",,"This work was supported in part by the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation under Grants 30940019 and 60377043, in part by the Guang Dong Provincial Science and Technology Foundation under Grants 2015B010105006 and 2013B060100011, and in part by the Guang Zhou Science and Technology Foundation under Grants 2014Y2-00508 and 201604020146.",IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,,,Artificial Intelligence; Crystallization; Female; Fetus; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Saliva,2022-05-05,2022,2022-05-05,2022-05,26,5,2320-2330,,,"Li, Zhou-Xuan; Zha, Yue-Ming; Jiang, Guang-Yun; Huang, Yao-Xiong","Li, Zhou-Xuan (Jinan University, Guang Zhou, 510632, China); Zha, Yue-Ming (Jinan University, Guang Zhou, 510632, China); Jiang, Guang-Yun (First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guang Zhou, 510630, China); Huang, Yao-Xiong (Jinan University, Guang Zhou, 510632, China)","Huang, Yao-Xiong (Jinan University)","Li, Zhou-Xuan (Jinan University); Zha, Yue-Ming (Jinan University); Jiang, Guang-Yun (First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University); Huang, Yao-Xiong (Jinan University)",4,4,,3.24,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143903268,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4601 Applied Computing,

However, it remains unclear whether other morphological features of the airway tree could be associated with the variation in lung function independent of dysanapsis. This study used lung cancer screening chest computed tomography (CT) and spirometry data from asymptomatic never smokers. Dysanapsis and the complexity of airway tree geometry were quantified on CT by measuring airway to lung ratio (ALR) and airway fractal dimension (AFD). Moreover, total airway count (TAC), ratio of airway luminal surface area to volume (SA/V), longitudinal tapering and irregularity of the radius of the internal lumen from the central to peripheral airways (Tapering index and Irregularity index) were quantified. In 431 asymptomatic never smokers without a history of lung diseases, lower ALR was associated with lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). The associations of ALR with AFD and TAC (r = 0.41 and 0.13) were weaker than the association between TAC and AFD (r = 0.64). In multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, height, and mean lung density, lower AFD and TAC were associated with lower FEV1 and FEV1/FVC independent of ALR, whereas SA/V and Tapering index were not. These results suggest that the smaller airway tree relative to a given lung size and the lower complexity of airway tree shape, including lower branch count, are independently associated with lower lung function in healthy subjects.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study showed that fractal dimension and total airway count of the airway tree on computed tomography are associated with lung function on spirometry independent of a smaller airway for a given lung size (dysanapsis) in asymptomatic never smokers without a history of lung diseases. In addition to dysanapsis, the morphometric complexity of the airway tree and the airway branch count may cause a substantial variation of lung function in these subjects.",,,Journal of Applied Physiology,,,"Humans; Fractals; Early Detection of Cancer; Smokers; Lung Neoplasms; Lung; Vital Capacity; Forced Expiratory Volume; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Spirometry; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",2022-10-21,2022,2022-10-21,2023-01-01,134,1,20-27,,,"Maetani, Tomoki; Tanabe, Naoya; Terada, Satoru; Shiraishi, Yusuke; Shima, Hiroshi; Kaji, Shizuo; Sakamoto, Ryo; Oguma, Tsuyoshi; Sato, Susumu; Masuda, Izuru; Hirai, Toyohiro","Maetani, Tomoki (Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.); Tanabe, Naoya (Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.); Terada, Satoru (Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.); Shiraishi, Yusuke (Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.); Shima, Hiroshi (Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.); Kaji, Shizuo (Institute of Mathematics for Industry, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.); Sakamoto, Ryo (Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Nuclear Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.); Oguma, Tsuyoshi (Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.); Sato, Susumu (Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.; Department of Respiratory Care and Sleep Control Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.); Masuda, Izuru (Medical Examination Center, Takeda Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.); Hirai, Toyohiro (Department of Respiratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.)","Tanabe, Naoya (Kyoto University)","Maetani, Tomoki (Kyoto University); Tanabe, Naoya (Kyoto University); Terada, Satoru (Kyoto University); Shiraishi, Yusuke (Kyoto University); Shima, Hiroshi (Kyoto University); Kaji, Shizuo (Kyushu University); Sakamoto, Ryo (Kyoto University); Oguma, Tsuyoshi (Kyoto University); Sato, Susumu (Kyoto University; Kyoto University); Masuda, Izuru (Ijinkai Takeda General Hospital); Hirai, Toyohiro (Kyoto University)",11,11,2.98,8.9,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152056282,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

To address this knowledge gap, laboratory tank experiments were conducted in fresh water to investigate the sensitivity of kaolinite flocculation to varying organic matter species and contents. Three species of organic matter (xanthan gum, guar gum and humic acid) were investigated at varying concentrations. Results revealed a significant enhancement in kaolinite flocculation when organic polymers (xanthan gum and guar gum) were introduced. In contrast, the addition of humic acid had minimal influence on aggregation and floc structure. Notably, the nonionic polymer guar gum demonstrated greater efficacy in promoting the development of floc size compared to the anionic polymer, xanthan gum. We observed non-linear trends in the evolution of mean floc size (Dm) and boundary fractal dimension (Np) with increasing ratios of organic polymer concentration to kaolinite concentration. Initially, increasing polymer content facilitated the formation of larger and more fractal flocs. However, beyond a certain threshold, further increases in polymer content hindered flocculation and even led to the break-up of macro-flocs, resulting in the formation of more spherical and compact flocs. We further quantified the co-relationships between floc Np and Dm and found that larger Np values corresponded to larger Dm. These findings highlight the significant impact of organic matter species and concentrations on floc size, shape and structure, and shed light on the complex dynamics of fine sediment and associated nutrients and contaminants in fluvial systems.","Declaration of competing interest We declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that can inappropriately influence our work, there is no professional or other interest of any nature or kind in any product, service and/or company that could be constructed as influencing the position presented in, or the review of, the MS entitled.

The elastic properties of these systems result from the network microstructure, which is very sensitive to shear history. Here, we take advantage of such sensitivity to tune the viscoelastic properties of a colloidal gel made of carbon black nanoparticles. Starting from a fluidized state at an applied shear rate 0, we use an abrupt flow cessation to trigger a liquid-to-solid transition. We observe that the resulting gel is all the more elastic when the shear rate 0 is low and that the viscoelastic spectra can be mapped on a master curve. Moreover, coupling rheometry to small angle X-ray scattering allows us to show that the gel microstructure is different from gels solely formed by thermal agitation where only two length scales are observed: the dimension of the colloidal and the dimension of the fractal aggregates. Competition between shear and thermal energy leads to gels with three characteristic length scales. Such gels structure in a percolated network of fractal clusters that interpenetrate each other. Experiments on gels prepared with various shear histories reveal that cluster interpenetration increases with decreasing values of the shear rate 0 applied before flow cessation. These observations strongly suggest that cluster interpenetration drives the gel elasticity, which we confirm using a structural model. Our results, which are in stark contrast to previous literature, where gel elasticity was either linked to cluster connectivity or to bending modes, highlight a novel local parameter controlling the macroscopic viscoelastic properties of colloidal gels.","We thank the ESRF for beamtime at the beamline ID02 (proposal SC5099).

Here we propose a simple theoretical model to describe the wetting properties of a droplet of water placed on a hierarchical structured surface and test the predictions of the model and the dependence of the droplet wetting state on the initial conditions using simulation of the 3-spin Potts model. We show that increasing the auto-similarity level of the hierarchy - called n - does not affect considerably the stable wetting state of the droplet but increases its contact angle. Simulations also explicit the existence of metastable states on this type of surfaces and shows that, when n increases, the metastability becomes more pronounced. Finally we show that the fractal dimension of the surface is not a good predictor of the contact angle of the droplet.",We thank the Brazilian agency CAPES and CNPq for the financial support.

The experimental data was collected in the form of high-speed recordings using a long-distance microscope as part of the ICAPS (Interactions in Cosmic and Atmospheric Particle Systems) experiment on board of the sounding rocket flight Texus-56. Our data analysis shows that the translational Brownian motion can be used to determine the mass and translational response time of each individual dust aggregate. The rotational Brownian motion additionally provides the moment of inertia and the rotational response time. A shallow positive correlation between mass and response time was found as predicted for aggregate structures with low fractal dimensions. Translational and rotational response times are roughly in agreement. Using the mass and the moment of inertia of each aggregate, we determined the fractal dimension of the aggregate ensemble. Slight deviations from the pure Gaussian one-dimensional displacement statistics were found in the ballistic limit for both the translational and rotational Brownian motion.","This work was part of the ICAPS mission, which was supported by the German Space Agency (DLR) under Grants No. 50WM0336, No. 50WM0636, No. 50WM0936, No. 50WM1236, No. 50WM1536, No. 50WM1846, and No. 50WM2146. and the European Space Agency (ESA) through their SciSpacE program for this project and the Texus-56 Sounding Rocket flight.

However, information on how the structure of the mandibular bone is affected is limited. In the present study, we aim to compare mandibular bone structures of children affected with CHD and healthy ones through the fractal analysis method and radiomorphometric indices based on panoramic radiographs. The study consisted of 80 children (20 with cyanotic CHD, 20 with acyanotic CHD, 40 control) who were diagnosed with CHD and were treated through interventional therapy or followed up through medical therapy. Fractal dimension (FD) was performed in three different areas (angulus, corpus, and interdental bone) on 80 panoramic radiographs. Additionally, we assessed various radiomorphometric indices: mandibular cortical width (MCW), panoramic mandibular index (PMI), mandibular cortical index (MCI), and simple visual estimation (SVE). p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant in the analysis. Values of mean MCW, PMI, MCI, SVE, and FD measurements in children affected with CHD were found to be similar to the control group, regardless of whether they were cyanotic or acyanotic (p > 0.05). In this study, fractal analysis and radiomorphometric indices revealed no trabecular structure and mineral density changes in mandibular bone of children and adolescents with CHD compared to healthy subjects.","We would like to thank Naci Ceviz and Fuat Laloğlu, who work at Ataturk University Research Hospital, Department of Pediatric Cardiology, for their contributions to the examination and classification of patients with heart problems.",This research received no external funding.,Children,,,,2023-01-27,2023,2023-01-27,,10,2,227,,,"Saraç, Fatma; Şengül, Fatih; Çelikel, Periş; Saraç, İbrahim; Baş, Aybike; Derelioğlu, Sera Şimşek","Saraç, Fatma (Department of Pedodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Ataturk University, 25240 Yakutiye, Turkey); Şengül, Fatih (Department of Pedodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Ataturk University, 25240 Yakutiye, Turkey); Çelikel, Periş (Department of Pedodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Ataturk University, 25240 Yakutiye, Turkey); Saraç, İbrahim (Department of Cardiology, Erzurum Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey); Baş, Aybike (Department of Pedodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Ataturk University, 25240 Yakutiye, Turkey); Derelioğlu, Sera Şimşek (Department of Pedodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Ataturk University, 25240 Yakutiye, Turkey)","Şengül, Fatih (Atatürk University)","Saraç, Fatma (Atatürk University); Şengül, Fatih (Atatürk University); Çelikel, Periş (Atatürk University); Saraç, İbrahim (Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital); Baş, Aybike (Atatürk University); Derelioğlu, Sera Şimşek (Atatürk University)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9067/10/2/227/pdf?version=1676443515,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154981003,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,

Multivariable logistic linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, mean arterial pressure, and the presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia showed a significant association between high CAVI values and the following retinal vessel geometry parameters: central retinal arteriolar equivalent caliber (CRAE; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.00; P = 0.043), fractal dimension of arteriolar network (FDa; AOR, 4.21 × 10-4; 95% CI, 2.32 × 10-7-0.77; P = 0.042), and arteriolar branching angle (BAa; AOR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; P = 0.007).
Conclusions: Increased systemic arterial stiffness had a significant association with retinal vessel geometry related to arterial narrowing (CRAE), less branching complexity of the arterial tree (FDa), and acute arteriolar bifurcation (BAa).",,"This research was supported by the SNUH Research Fund (grant no. 0420190710), and the Hallym University Medical Center Research Fund and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (grant no. 2021R1G1A1093576).",Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,,,,2023-06-19,2023,2023-06-19,,10,,1139557,,,"Joong, Dae; Lee, Heesun; Choi, Ji Min; Park, Hyo Eun; Choi, Su-Yeon; Choi, Hyuk Jin","Joong, Dae (Department of Ophthalmology, Hallym University Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea; These authors share first authorship); Lee, Heesun (Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Cardiology, Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea; These authors share first authorship); Choi, Ji Min (Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Gastroenterology, Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Park, Hyo Eun (Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Cardiology, Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Choi, Su-Yeon (Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Division of Cardiology, Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Choi, Hyuk Jin (Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Ophthalmology, Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea)","Choi, Hyuk Jin (Seoul National University; Seoul National University Hospital)","Joong, Dae (Hallym University Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital; These authors share first authorship); Lee, Heesun (Seoul National University; Seoul National University Hospital; These authors share first authorship); Choi, Ji Min (Seoul National University; Seoul National University Hospital); Park, Hyo Eun (Seoul National University; Seoul National University Hospital); Choi, Su-Yeon (Seoul National University; Seoul National University Hospital); Choi, Hyuk Jin (Seoul National University; Seoul National University Hospital)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2023.1139557/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159993871,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,

Moreover, due to differences in the mineralogical characteristics of CSD, different particle size scales (PSSs) have different functional structures and exhibit different self-similarities. In this study, we took CSD as the research object and PSS as the entry point and carried out a self-similarity study based on gas adsorption and an image processing method to illustrate the microstructures and self-similarities of different PSSs. The results showed that the pore structure of the CSD was dominated by mesopores and macropores and basically lacked micropores. The fractal dimensions were calculated with the Frenkel-Haisey-Hill (FHH) model and Menger model, and the DF1 values for − 0.025 mm and − 2 mm were 2.51 and 2.48, respectively, and the DM1 values were 3.75 and 3.79, respectively, indicating that the mesopore structure of the fine PSS was complex, whereas macropores were present in the coarse PSS. MATLAB was programmed to obtain grayscale thresholds, binarized images, grayscale histograms, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction images and box dimensions, which enabled us to observe the microstructures and self-similarities of the CSD. Self-similarity studies based on particle sizes are very important for functional application of CSD.Please note that article title mismatch between MS and JS we have followed MS, kindly check and cofirm.Yes, I have checked and confirmed.Kindly check and confirm corresponding author mail id are correctly identified.Yes, I have checked and confirmed.",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 51372108 to Z.M.).,,Scientific Reports,,,,2024-03-29,2024,2024-03-29,,14,1,7502,,,"Cheng, Liang; Wang, Guangming; Ma, Zhijun; Guo, Hao; Gao, Ye; Zhang, Qi; Gao, Jing; Fu, Hanghang","Cheng, Liang (College of Mining, Liaoning Technical University, 123000, Fuxin, China); Wang, Guangming (College of Mining, Liaoning Technical University, 123000, Fuxin, China); Ma, Zhijun (College of Material Science and Engineering, Liaoning Technical University, 123000, Fuxin, China); Guo, Hao (School of Resources and Civil Engineering, Northeastern University, 110003, Shenyang, China); Gao, Ye (Liaoning Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources Co., Ltd, 110032, Shenyang, China); Zhang, Qi (College of Mining, Liaoning Technical University, 123000, Fuxin, China); Gao, Jing (College of Mining, Liaoning Technical University, 123000, Fuxin, China); Fu, Hanghang (College of Mining, Liaoning Technical University, 123000, Fuxin, China)","Cheng, Liang (Liaoning Technical University); Ma, Zhijun (Liaoning Technical University)","Cheng, Liang (Liaoning Technical University); Wang, Guangming (Liaoning Technical University); Ma, Zhijun (Liaoning Technical University); Guo, Hao (Northeastern University); Gao, Ye (Liaoning Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources Co., Ltd, 110032, Shenyang, China); Zhang, Qi (Liaoning Technical University); Gao, Jing (Liaoning Technical University); Fu, Hanghang (Liaoning Technical University)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-57710-x.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170240773,34 Chemical Sciences; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 40 Engineering,

In this study, the microscopic pore distribution characteristics of fiber-reinforced cement mortar were obtained by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology. The change trend of T2 spectrum curve and porosity cumulative distribution curve showed that the freeze-thaw resistance of cement mortar increased first and then decreased with the fiber content. The optimal fiber content was approximately 0.5%. By conducting mechanical experiments, it is found that the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of the samples exhibited the 'upward convex' evolution trends with freeze-thaw cycles due to cement hydration, and based on fractal theory, the negative correlation between UCS and Dmin was established. Eventually, a freeze-thaw strength prediction model considering both porosity and pore distribution was proposed, which could accurately predict the strength deterioration law of cement-based materials under freeze-thaw conditions.",,This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation Project of China under Grant No. 51978665 and 52004327.,Materials,,A.

In this work, we investigate the collective assembly of building units at the early stages of MOF nucleation, using MIL-101(Cr) as a prototypical example. Using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we observe that the choice of solvent (water and N,N-dimethylformamide), the introduction of ions (Na+ and F-) and the relative populations of MIL-101(Cr) half-secondary building unit (half-SBU) isomers have a strong influence on the cluster formation process. Additionally, the shape, size, nucleation and growth rates, crystallinity, and short and long-range order largely vary depending on the synthesis conditions. We evaluate these properties as they naturally emerge when interpreting the self-assembly of MOF nuclei as the time evolution of an undirected graph. Solution-induced conformational complexity and ionic concentration have a dramatic effect on the morphology of clusters emerging during assembly. While pure solvents lead to the rapid formation of a small number of large clusters, the presence of ions in aqueous solutions results in smaller clusters and slower nucleation. This diversity is captured by the key features of the graph representation. Principle component analysis on graph properties reveals that only a small number of molecular descriptors is needed to deconvolute MOF self-assembly. Descriptors such as the average coordination number between half-SBUs and fractal dimension are of particulalr interest as they can be can be followed experimentally by techniques like by time-resolved spectroscopy. Ultimately, graph theory emerges as an approach that can be used to understand complex processes revealing molecular descriptors accessible by both simulation and experiment.","The work described in this publication was performed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which is operated by Battelle for the United States Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract DE-AC05-76RL0180.

LMN degeneration assessment is aided by electromyography, whereas no equivalent exists to assess UMN dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is primarily used to exclude conditions that mimic ALS. We have identified four different clinical/radiological phenotypes of ALS patients. We hypothesize that these ALS phenotypes arise from distinct pathologic processes that result in unique MRI signatures. To our knowledge, no machine learning (ML)-based data analyses have been performed to stratify different ALS phenotypes using MRI measures. During routine clinical evaluation, we obtained T1-, T2-, PD-weighted, diffusion tensor (DT) brain MRI of 15 neurological controls and 91 ALS patients (UMN-predominant ALS with corticospinal tract CST) hyperintensity, n = 21; UMN-predominant ALS without CST hyperintensity, n = 26; classic ALS, n = 23; and ALS patients with frontotemporal dementia, n = 21). From these images, we obtained 101 white matter (WM) attributes (including DT measures, graph theory measures from DT and fractal dimension (FD) measures using T1-weighted), 10 grey matter (GM) attributes (including FD based measures from T1-weighted), and 10 non-imaging attributes (2 demographic and 8 clinical measures of ALS). We employed classification and regression tree, Random Forest (RF) and also artificial neural network for the classifications. RF algorithm provided the best accuracy (70-94%) in classifying four different phenotypes of ALS patients. WM metrics played a dominant role in classifying different phenotypes when compared to GM or clinical measures. Although WM measures from both right and left hemispheres need to be considered to identify ALS phenotypes, they appear to be differentially affected by the degenerative process.

This increase is non-specific to the type of age-related disease, although each disease develops through a unique pathophysiologic mechanism. People who age at a faster rate develop age-related diseases earlier in their life. They have an older “biological age” compared to their “chronological age”. Early detection of individuals with accelerated aging would allow timely intervention to postpone the onset of age-related diseases. This would increase their life expectancy and their length of good quality life. The goal of this study was to investigate whether retinal microvascular complexity could be used as a biomarker of biological age. Retinal images of 68 participants ages ranging from 19 to 82 years were collected in an observational cross-sectional study. Twenty of the old participants had age-related diseases such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and/or Alzheimer’s dementia. The rest of the participants were healthy. Retinal images were captured by a hand-held, non-mydriatic fundus camera and quantification of the microvascular complexity was performed by using Sholl’s, box-counting fractal, and lacunarity analysis. In the healthy subjects, increasing chronological age was associated with lower retinal microvascular complexity measured by Sholl’s analysis. Decreased box-counting fractal dimension was present in old patients, and this decrease was 2.1 times faster in participants who had age-related diseases (p = 0.047). Retinal microvascular complexity could be a promising new biomarker of biological age. The data from this study is the first of this kind collected in Montenegro.

Initial treatment of MDD often starts with administering antidepressants, followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for treatment-resistant individuals. The purpose of this case study was to determine the effect of repetitive TMS (rTMS) on postural control of an individual with MDD. A 44-year-old male with recurrent severe MDD was assessed for postural balance during eyes closed and eyes open conditions, pre and post three consecutive sessions receiving high-frequency rTMS (NeuroStar). Total excursion and velocity of sway significantly decreased following rTMS treatment when eyes were closed (p < 0.05). Power of the sway changed, but the changes were not statistically significant. The fractal dimension confidence circle area decreased significantly in eyes closed trials (p < 0.05). It appears that rTMS application can potentially impact postural steadiness in individuals with MDD. Our results warrant further studies with larger study samples.","The authors thank the school of Allied Health and Communicative Disorders at Northern Illinois University for their equipment support for the data collection of this study.

This science motif is based on the scaling arising from the 1/f-variability in complex dynamic networks and the need for a network of networks to exchange information internally during intra-network dynamics and externally during inter-network dynamics. The measure of complexity adopted herein is the multifractal dimension of the crucial event time series generated by an organ network, and the difference in the multifractal dimensions of two organ networks quantifies the relative complexity between interacting complex networks. Information flows from dynamic networks at a higher level of complexity to those at lower levels of complexity, as summarized in the 'complexity matching effect', and the flow is maximally efficient when the complexities are equal. Herein, we use the scaling of empirical datasets from the brain, cardiovascular and respiratory networks to support the hypothesis that complexity synchronization occurs between scaling indices or equivalently with the matching of the time dependencies of the networks' multifractal dimensions.",The authors would like to extend their sincere appreciation to the US Army Research Laboratory for support.,This study was supported by US Army Research Laboratory cooperative agreement W911NF-16-2-0008.,Entropy,,,,2023-09-28,2023,2023-09-28,,25,10,1393,,,"West, Bruce J.; Grigolini, Paolo; Kerick, Scott E.; Franaszczuk, Piotr J.; Mahmoodi, Korosh","West, Bruce J.

In this paper, we propose a principled framework for producing a family of stochastic growth tree networks T possessing fractal characteristic, where t represents the time step and parameter m is the number of vertices newly created for each existing vertex at generation. To this end, we introduce two types of generative ways, i.e., Edge-Operation and Edge-Vertex-Operation. More interestingly, the resulting stochastic trees turn out to have an identical fractal dimension d = ln ⁡ 2 ( m + 1 ) / ln ⁡ 2 regardless of the introduction of randomness in the growth process. At the same time, we also study many other structural parameters including diameter and degree distribution. In both extreme cases, our tree networks are deterministic and follow multiple-point degree distribution and power-law degree distribution, respectively. Additionally, we consider random walks on stochastic growth tree networks T and derive an expectation estimation for mean hitting time ⟨ H ⟩ in an effective combinatorial manner instead of commonly used spectral methods. The result shows that on average, the scaling of mean hitting time ⟨ H ⟩ obeys ⟨ H ⟩ = | T |, where | T | represents vertex number and exponent λ is equivalent to 1 + ln ⁡ 2 / ln ⁡ 2 ( m + 1 ). In the meantime, we conduct extensive experimental simulations and observe that empirical analysis is in strong agreement with theoretical results.","We would like to appreciate anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on our paper, which have considerably improved the presentation of this paper.

High-resolution maps of adhesion between the AFM probe and the cell surface were used in that study. However, the separation of cancerous and precancerous cells was rather poor (the area under the curve (AUC) was only 0.79, whereas the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 74%, 58%, and 84%, respectively). At the same time, the separation between premalignant and malignant cells is the most significant from a clinical point of view. Here, we show that the introduction of machine learning methods for the analysis of adhesion maps allows us to distinguish precancerous and cancerous cervical cells with rather good precision (AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 0.93, 83%, 92%, and 78%, respectively). Substantial improvement in sensitivity is significant because of the unmet need in clinical practice to improve the screening of cervical cancer (a relatively low specificity can be compensated by combining this approach with other currently existing screening methods). The random forest decision tree algorithm was utilized in this study. The analysis was carried out using the data of six precancerous primary cell lines and six cancerous primary cell lines, each derived from different humans. The robustness of the classification was verified using K-fold cross-validation (K = 500). The results are statistically significant at p < 0.0001.

Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) is one of China's most important plantation species. To clarify the effects of propagation methods on root growth and spatial distribution characteristics of Chinese fir trees, sampled trees cultivated by seed germination, tissue culture, and asexual cutting of Chinese fir were taken as the research objects. The root morphology, geometric configuration, and spatial distribution characteristics of different trees were analyzed. The influence of geometric root morphology on its spatial distribution pattern was explored by correlation analysis, and the resource acquisition characteristics reflected by the roots of Chinese fir trees with different propagation methods are discussed. The main results showed that the root mean diameter (1.56 mm, 0.95 mm, and 0.97 mm), root volume (2.98 m3, 10.25 m3, and 4.07 m3), root tip count (397, 522, and 440), main root branch angle (61°, 50° and 32°) and other geometric configurations of Chinese fir under seed germination, tissue culture and rooted cutting respectively, were significantly different, which resulted in different distribution characteristics of roots in space. Chinese fir seed germination had noticeable axial roots, and the growth advantage was obvious in the vertical direction. A fishtail branch structure (TI = 0.87) was constructed. The shallow root distribution of tissue culture and rooted cutting was obvious, and belonged to the fork branch structure (TI = 0.71 and 0.74, respectively). There was a tradeoff in the spatial growth of the root system of Chinese fir trees with different propagation methods to absorb nutrients from heterogeneous soil patches. A negative correlation was present between the root system and root amplitude. There was an opposite spatial growth trend of Chinese fir trees with different propagation methods in the vertical or horizontal direction. In conclusion, selecting suitable propagation methods to cultivate Chinese fir trees is beneficial to root development and the ""ideal"" configuration formation of resource acquisition to improve the survival rate of Chinese fir afforestation.",,"The study was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFD2201304-05), the Key Program of Natural Science of Fujian Province, China (grant number 2020J02029), and the Science and Technology Project of Fuzhou Science and Technology Bureau, Fujian Province, China (grant number 2021-P-035).",Plants,,"Xiaoyong Chen, Wende Yan, Taimoor Hassan Farooq",,2022-09-21,2022,2022-09-21,,11,19,2472,,,"Li, Linxin; Deng, Xianhua; Zhang, Ting; Tian, Yunlong; Ma, Xiangqing; Wu, Pengfei","Li, Linxin (College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China); Deng, Xianhua (College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China); Zhang, Ting (College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China); Tian, Yunlong (College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China); Ma, Xiangqing (College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China); Wu, Pengfei (College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China)","Wu, Pengfei (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China)","Li, Linxin (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China); Deng, Xianhua (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China); Zhang, Ting (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China); Tian, Yunlong (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China); Ma, Xiangqing (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China); Wu, Pengfei (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University; Chinese Fir Engineering Technology Research Center of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Fuzhou 350002, China)",3,3,0.49,1.75,https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/11/19/2472/pdf?version=1663847810,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151245081,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 31 Biological Sciences; 3103 Ecology; 3108 Plant Biology",

Water nanoislands on the pristine Cu(111) surface are compared to those at similar coverage on a Rb+ pre-covered Cu(111) surface to reveal the structure-giving effect of Rb+. The presence of Rb+ induces changes in the island shape, and hence, the water network, without affecting the nanoisland volume. The broad area distribution shifts to larger values while the height decreases from three bilayers to one or two bilayers. The nanoislands on the Rb+ pre-covered surface are also more compact, reflected in a shift in the fractal dimension distribution.

To this end, using the principle of coordinate transformation, the kinematic trajectory of the cutting head of the tunneling machine is established, and the contour morphology of the cutting head under variable cutting technology is obtained. Then, based on the regenerative vibration theory of the cutting head, a dynamic model of the cutting head coal wall is established, and the coordinate relationship of the cutting head in the tunnel coordinate system under vibration induction is analyzed. Based on fractal theory and Z-MAP method, a simulation method for the surface morphology of coal and rock after cutting is proposed, which is driven by the cutting trajectory Under the coupling effect of cutting vibration induction and random fragmentation of coal and rock, simulation of the surface morphology of comprehensive excavation tunnels was conducted, and relevant experiments were conducted to verify the results. A 1:3 similarity experimental model of EBZ160 tunneling machine was used to build a cutting head coal and rock system cutting experimental platform for comparative experiments of cutting morphology. Furthermore, statistical methods were used to compare and evaluate the simulated roof with the actual roof. The results show that the relative errors between the maximum range of peaks and valleys, the peak skewness coefficient of height standard deviation, and the kurtosis coefficient of the actual roof are 1.3%, 24.5%, 16%, and 2.9%, respectively.

The research focus of this paper is process simulation of coalbed methane (CBM) production. The dynamic variation of pore volume with different pore sizes during pressure drop, methane desorption-diffusion process, and methane-water interaction during migration is discussed. Moreover, the calculation principles of NMR single and multifractal models are systematically described, and the applicability of NMR fractal models within different research contexts is discussed. Four aspects need urgent attention in the application of this technology in CBM production: (1) overburden NMR technology has limitations in characterizing the stress sensitivity of shale and high-rank coal reservoirs with micropores developed, and we should aim to enable an accurate description of micropore pore stress sensitivity; (2) dynamic NMR physical simulation of reservoir gas and water production based on in-situ and actual geological development conditions should become one of the key aspects of follow-up research; (3) low-temperature freeze-thaw NMR technology, as a new pore-fracture characterization method, needs to be further applied in characterizing the distribution characteristics of pores and fractures; and (4) NMR fractal model should be used as the main theoretical method to expand the simulation results. The applicability of different fractal models in characterizing pore-fracture structure (static) and CBM production process (dynamic) needs to be clarified.","This research was sponsored by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, China (Nos.

The binary systems are studied by varying bond flexibility of only one species, while the other species' bonds remain fully flexible. By establishing the underlying relation between gelation and bond rigidity, we demonstrate how the interplay among bond flexibility, critical concentration, and packing volume fraction influenced the aggregation kinetics. Our result shows that rigidity in bonds increases the critical concentration for gels to be formed in the binary mixture. Furthermore, the average number of bonded neighbor analyses reveal the influence of bond rigidity both above and below critical concentrations and show that variation in bond flexibility in only one species alters the kinetics of aggregation of both species.

As a disruption to this paradigm, here, we report the development of a smartphone-based sensor for rapid screening of anemic patients by exploiting the patterns formed by a spreading drop of blood on a wet paper strip wherein blood attempts to displace a more viscous fluid, on the porous matrix of a paper, leading to ""finger-like"" projections at the interface. We analyze the topological features of the pattern via smartphone-enabled image analytics and map the same with the relative occupancy of the red blood cells in the blood sample, allowing for label-free screening and classification of blood samples corresponding to moderate to severe anemic conditions. The accuracy of detection is verified by comparing with gold standard reports of hematology analyzer, showing a strong correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.975.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, cross-sectional, observational pilot study was conducted of 120 subjects, including controls and 3 study groups of 30 patients each with oral submucous fibrosis, tobacco pouch keratosis, and oral leukoplakia (OL). Two observers calculated FD and the RMIs of mandibular cortical thickness (MCT), panoramic mandibular index (PMI), and mandibular cortical index (MCI).
RESULTS: Mean FD was significantly reduced compared to controls with all oral lesions (P < .05) and with all habits in 3 of 4 regions of interest (P < .05). MCT was significantly reduced with OL (P < .005) and in ST users (P < .05). PMI did not differ regarding lesion status or habits. Compared to the controls, MCI C2 type was significantly more common in all oral lesions (P ≤ .005) and all types of habit (P < .005). Inter- and intraobserver agreement was strong to excellent.

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical and radiographic records from 33 periodontally healthy individuals and 28 individuals with aggressive periodontitis were obtained from the faculty archives. Three regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen bilaterally from interdental bone around the mandibular first molar and canine and the antegonial region. The mean fractal dimension (FD) values of the ROIs were calculated. Significance of differences was established at P < .05.
RESULTS: FD values of all 3 ROIs in the periodontitis group were significantly lower than values in the control group (P ≤ .004). FD was not affected by patient age (P = .357) or sex (P = .216). There were no significant correlations between FD and age in either group (P ≥ .093). FD values differed significantly between sexes in only one ROI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 16 patients who received posterior mandibular area dental implants with CBCT scans taken about 2 weeks after implantation and one year after implantation were analyzed. A region of interest was selected for each patient. FDs and GSVs were evaluated immediately after implant surgery and at 12-month follow-up to examine the functional loading of the implants.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between DPR and CBCT measurements of FD values (P>0.05). No significant differences were observed between FD values and GSVs calculated after implant surgery and at the 12-month follow-up (P>0.05). GSVs were not correlated with FD values (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: The DPR and reconstructed panoramic CBCT images exhibit similar image quality for the assessment of FD. There were no changes in FD values or GSVs of the peri-implant trabecular bone structure at the 12-month postoperative evaluation of the functional loading of the implant in comparison to values immediately after implantation. GSVs representing bone mass do not align with FD values that predict bone microstructural parameters. Therefore, GSVs and FDs should be considered different parameters for assessing bone quality.","This research was conducted at the Necmettin Erbakan University, Faculty of Dentistry, Konya, Turkey.

This is due to the proper choice of the monoaldehyde that can tune the hydrogel properties for specific practices. In this conceptual framework, the present paper deals with the investigation of a hydrogel as bioabsorbable wound dressing. To this aim, chitosan was cross-linked with 2-formylphenylboronic acid to yield a hydrogel with antimicrobial activity. FTIR, NMR, and POM procedures have characterized the hydrogel from a structural and supramolecular point of view. At the same time, its biocompatibility and antimicrobial properties were also determined in vitro. Furthermore, in order to assess the bioabsorbable character, its biodegradation was investigated in vitro in the presence of lysosome in media of different pH, mimicking the wound exudate at different stages of healing. The biodegradation was monitored by gravimetrical measurements, SEM microscopy and fractal analyses of the images. The fractal dimension values and the lacunarity of SEM pictures were accurately calculated. All these successful investigations led to the conclusion that the tested materials are at the expected high standards.",,"This work was partly supported by a grant of the Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization, CNCS/CCCDI–UEFISCDI, project number 538PED/2020 within PNCDI III.",Gels,,Damien Dupin,,2022-02-10,2022,2022-02-10,,8,2,107,,,"Lungu, Ramona; Paun, Maria-Alexandra; Peptanariu, Dragos; Ailincai, Daniela; Marin, Luminita; Nichita, Mihai-Virgil; Paun, Vladimir-Alexandru; Paun, Viorel-Puiu","Lungu, Ramona (Petru Poni” Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry, Gr.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in bone healing before and after decompression of nonsyndromic odontogenic cysts in children.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed including children diagnosed with nonsyndromic odontogenic cysts between January 2016 and December 2020. Study variables included the measurement times (baseline: T0, 1-month postoperative: T1, and end treatment: T2), measurement regions (middle cyst and control area), maxilla, and mandible. The primary and secondary outcome variables were fractal dimension (FD), treatment time, and cyst volume, respectively. Bone healing was evaluated using the fractal analysis method, the results of which are expressed as the FD. Data were analyzed by Friedman repeated measures analysis of variance by ranks, the Wilcoxon rank, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, Spearman correlation analysis, and linear regression model.
RESULTS: Twenty-three children (9 girls,14 boys) with a mean age of 9.57 ± 2.02 years were included into the study. A comparison of the measurement regions showed that the middle cyst area (1.279 ± 0.090) had significantly lower FD values than control area before decompression (T0; P < .001). Statistically significant differences were observed in FD values at T0, T1, and T2 (1.279 ± 0.090, 1.311 ± 0.090, and 1.384 ± 0.075) in the middle cyst area (P <. 001). After decompression, no significant difference was found in FD values between the middle cyst (1.384 ± 0.075) and the control area (1.401 ± 0.050).

Three models are studied based on the shapes of the aggregates: In the first the aggregates remain point particles, in the second they retain the fractal shape at the time of collision, and in the third they assume a spherical shape. The exponents describing the power-law temporal decay of number of particles and energy as well as dependence of velocity correlations on mass are determined using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the exponents are universal only for the point-particle model. In the other two cases, the exponents are dependent on the initial number density and correlations vanish at high number densities.

Balance tests such as standing with eyes open (EO) or closed (EC) give a possibility to calculate both linear and nonlinear indicators. This study aimed to find the group of linear and/or nonlinear measures that can differentiate healthy people and patients with TKR or THR from each other. This study enrolled 49 THR patients, 53 TKR patients, and 16 healthy controls. The center of pressure (CoP) path length, sample entropy (SampEn), fractal dimension (FD), and the largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) were calculated separately for AP and ML directions from standing with EO/EC. Cluster analysis did not result in correct allocation to the groups according to all variables. The discriminant model included LyE (ML-EO, ML-EC, AP-EC), FD (AP-EO, ML-EC, AP-EC), CoP-path AP-EC, and SampEn AP-EC. Regression analysis showed that all nonlinear variables depend on the group. The CoP path length is different only in THR patients. It was concluded that standing with EC is a better way to assess the amount of regularity of CoP movement and attention paid to maintain balance. Nonlinear measures better differentiate TKR and THR patients from healthy controls.","The authors would like to acknowledge Edyta Urbaniak, Agnieszka Kobza, and Rafał Boratyński for their support in data collection and Małgorzata Syczewska for her comments on the final version of the manuscript.","This research was funded by a National Centre for Research and Development Grant under the program Strategmed III as part of the “VB-Clinic” project (no.

Traditionally, two-dimensional (2D) instead of 3D fractal dimension (FD) analysis has been used to evaluate trabecular disarray. However, the prognostic value of trabecular disorder assessed by 3D FD measurement remains unclear.
PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic value of right ventricular trabecular complexity in ACM patients using 3D FD analysis based on cardiac MR cine images.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.
POPULATION: 85 ACM patients (mean age: 45 ± 17 years, 52 male).
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T/cine imaging, T2-short tau inversion recovery (T2-STIR), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE).
ASSESSMENT: Using cine images, RV (right ventricular) volumetric and functional parameters were obtained. RV trabecular complexity was measured with 3D fractal analysis by box-counting method to calculate 3D-FD. Cox and logistic regression models were established to evaluate the prognostic value of 3D-FD for major adverse cardiac events (MACE).
STATISTICAL TESTS: Cox regression and logistic regression to explore the prognostic value of 3D-FD. C-index, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curve (AUC) to evaluate the incremental value of 3D-FD. Intraclass correlation coefficient for interobserver variability. P < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.
RESULTS: 26 MACE were recorded during the 60 month follow-up (interquartile range: 48-67 months). RV 3D-FD significantly differed between ACM patients with MACE (2.67, interquartile range: 2.51 ~ 2.81) and without (2.52, interquartile range: 2.40 ~ 2.67) and was a significant independent risk factor for MACE (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.04). In addition, prognostic model fitness was significantly improved after adding 3D-FD to RV global longitudinal strain, LV involvement, and 5-year risk score separately.
DATA CONCLUSION: The myocardial trabecular complexity assessed through 3D FD analysis was found associated with MACE and provided incremental prognostic value beyond conventional ACM risk factors.

Thus, retinal imaging has been of interest in the aging population to help in the early detection of brain disorders. Imaging evaluation of brain frailty, including brain atrophy and markers of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), could reflect brain health in normal aging, but is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the retinal microvasculature and its association with radiological indicators of brain frailty in normal aging adults.
Methods: Swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) and 3T-MRI brain scanning were performed on normal aging adults (aged ≥ 50 years). Using a deep learning algorithm, microvascular tortuosity (VT) and fractal dimension parameter (Dbox) were used to evaluate the superficial vascular complex (SVC) and deep vascular complex (DVC) of the retina. MRI markers of brain frailty include brain volumetric measures and CSVD markers that were assessed.
Results: Of the 139 normal aging individuals included, the mean age was 59.43 ± 7.31 years, and 64.0% (n = 89) of the participants were females. After adjustment of age, sex, and vascular risk factors, Dbox in the DVC showed a significant association with the presence of lacunes (β = 0.58, p = 0.007), while VT in the SVC significantly correlated with the score of cerebral deep white matter hyperintensity (β = 0.31, p = 0.027). No correlations were found between brain volumes and retinal microvasculature changes (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: Our report suggests that imaging of the retinal microvasculature may give clues to brain frailty in the aging population.",We would like to thank volunteers participating in our study.,"This study was funded by the 1.3.5 project for disciplines of excellence, West China Hospital, Sichuan University (ZYGD18009), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 81601022).",Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,,,,2022-08-22,2022,2022-08-22,,14,,945964,,,"Tao, Wendan; Kwapong, William Robert; Xie, Jianyang; Wang, Zetao; Guo, Xiaonan; Liu, Junfeng; Ye, Chen; Wu, Bo; Zhao, Yitian; Liu, Ming","Tao, Wendan (Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Kwapong, William Robert (Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Xie, Jianyang (Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, China); Wang, Zetao (Department of Radiology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Guo, Xiaonan (School of Information Science and Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China); Liu, Junfeng (Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Ye, Chen (Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Wu, Bo (Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China); Zhao, Yitian (The Affiliated People’s Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, China; Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, China); Liu, Ming (Department of Neurology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China)","Zhao, Yitian (Ningbo University; Ningbo Institute of Industrial Technology); Liu, Ming (Sichuan University; West China Hospital of Sichuan University)","Tao, Wendan (Sichuan University; West China Hospital of Sichuan University); Kwapong, William Robert (Sichuan University; West China Hospital of Sichuan University); Xie, Jianyang (Ningbo Institute of Industrial Technology); Wang, Zetao (West China Hospital of Sichuan University); Guo, Xiaonan (Yanshan University); Liu, Junfeng (Sichuan University; West China Hospital of Sichuan University); Ye, Chen (Sichuan University; West China Hospital of Sichuan University); Wu, Bo (Sichuan University; West China Hospital of Sichuan University); Zhao, Yitian (Ningbo University; Ningbo Institute of Industrial Technology); Liu, Ming (Sichuan University; West China Hospital of Sichuan University)",11,11,2.77,9.69,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2022.945964/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150393973,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,

The placenta's structure suffers dynamic modifications throughout the whole pregnancy and many of these changes, in which placental microcalcifications are by far the most prominent, are related to the process of aging and maturation and have no effect on fetal wellbeing. However, when placental microcalcifications are noticed earlier during pregnancy, they could suggest a major placental dysfunction with serious consequences for the fetus and mother. For better detectability of microcalcifications, we propose a new approach based on improving the clarity of details and the analysis of the placental structure using first and second order statistics, and fractal dimension. (2) Methods: The methodology is based on four stages: (i) cropping the region of interest and preprocessing steps; (ii) feature extraction, first order-standard deviation (SD), skewness (SK) and kurtosis (KR)-and second order-contrast (C), homogeneity (H), correlation (CR), energy (E) and entropy (EN)-are computed from a gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and fractal dimension (FD); (iii) statistical analysis (t-test); (iv) classification with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (K-NN algorithm) and performance comparison with results from the support vector machine algorithm (SVM algorithm). (3) Results: Experimental results obtained from real clinical data show an improvement in the detectability and visibility of placental microcalcifications.",,"This research was partially supported under Contract no.

Coagulation, a common method of dewatering, can significantly enhance the dewatering performance of dredged sediment. This study synthesized a cationic starch-based flocculant [starch-3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride (St-CTA)] through etherification for the flocculation dewatering of dredged sediment. The effectiveness and mechanism of St-CTA as a dewatering flocculant for dredged sediment were investigated. The results demonstrated that when the dosage of St-CTA was 12 mg g-1 TSS (total suspended solids), the dehydration property of dredged sediment substantially improved, with the specific resistance to filtration (SRF) decreasing by 93.3%, the capillary suction time (CST) by 93.5%, and the water content of the filter cake (WC) by 9.7%. The removal rate of turbidity of the supernatant from the conditioned dredged sediment reached 99.6%, accelerating the settling speed and effectively capturing and separating fine particles from the sediment. St-CTA significantly increased the median particle size (D50), altered the microstructure and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the flocs, and increased the fractal dimension of the flocs, making them more compact and conducive to the formation of drainage channels. These findings confirm the feasibility of using potentially environmentally friendly St-CTA as a rapid dewatering conditioning agent for sediment.","This research was financially supported by Research Project of Guangxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology Department (No. GuiKe AD23026330 and No. GuiKe AB23026119), National Natural Science Foundations of China (No. 52270105), Science and Technology Innovation Program from Water Resources of Guangdong Province (No. 2023-03).",,RSC Advances,,,,2024-05-28,2024,2024,2024-05-28,14,25,17547-17556,,,"Tang, Shilei; Huang, Shaobin; Chen, Pengfei; Wu, Zhipeng; Zhao, Tianyu","Tang, Shilei (School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, Higher Education Mega Center, Guangzhou 510006, P.

In addition, the quantitative relationships among the diffusion coefficient, temperature, pressure, and structural parameters were determined. The model considers the effect of pore tortuosity and connectivity on gas diffusion, which renders it more realistic than the previously presented single-pore diffusion models. Moreover, each parameter in the model has a definite physical meaning and does not contain any empirical constants. The applicability of the new model was verified by experimental data and other model. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis of the gas diffusion coefficient was performed to study the effect of the microstructural parameters on gas diffusion. Finally, the dispersion degree of the diffusion coefficients at different temperatures and pressures was analyzed to determine the main influencing factors of gas diffusion at different diffusion stages in coal and study their evolution. The results show that the gas diffusion state is more sensitive to pressure variations.

The purpose of the study was to use NFN+ deep learning models to analyze retinal vessel characteristics for cognitive impairment (CI) recognition.MethodsWe included 908 participants from a community-based cohort followed for over 15 years (the prospective KaiLuan Study) who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fundus photography between 2021 and 2022. The cohort consisted of both cognitively healthy individuals (N = 417) and those with cognitive impairment (N = 491). We employed the NFN+ deep learning framework for retinal vessel segmentation and measurement. Associations between Retinal microvascular parameters (RMPs: central retinal arteriolar / venular equivalents, arteriole to venular ratio, fractal dimension) and CI were assessed by Pearson correlation. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The correlation between the CI and RMPs were explored, then the correlation coefficients between CI and RMPs were analyzed. Random Forest nonlinear classification model was used to predict whether one having cognitive decline or not. The assessment criterion was the AUC value derived from the working characteristic curve.ResultsThe fractal dimension (FD) and global vein width were significantly correlated with the CI (P < 0.05). Age (0.193), BMI (0.154), global vein width (0.106), retinal vessel FD (0.099), and CRAE (0.098) were the variables in this model that were ranked in order of feature importance. The AUC values of the model were 0.799.ConclusionsEstablishment of a predictive model based on the extraction of vascular features from fundus images has a high recognizability and predictive power for cognitive function and can be used as a screening method for CI.",No applicable.,This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (82272072) and Beijing key Clinical Discipline Funding (2021–135).,BMC Geriatrics,,,Humans; Deep Learning; Prospective Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Retina; Retinal Vessels; Biomarkers,2024-01-06,2024,2024-01-06,,24,1,28,,,"Li, Rui; Hui, Ying; Zhang, Xiaoyue; Zhang, Shun; Lv, Bin; Ni, Yuan; Li, Xiaoshuai; Liang, Xiaoliang; Yang, Ling; Lv, Han; Yin, Zhiyu; Li, Hongyang; Yang, Yingping; Liu, Guangfeng; Li, Jing; Xie, Guotong; Wu, Shouling; Wang, Zhenchang","Li, Rui (Department of Radiology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China); Hui, Ying (Department of Radiology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China); Zhang, Xiaoyue (Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China); Zhang, Shun (Department of Psychiatry, Kailuan Mental Health Centre, Hebei province, Tangshan, China); Lv, Bin (Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China); Ni, Yuan (Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China); Li, Xiaoshuai (Department of Radiology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China); Liang, Xiaoliang (Department of Psychiatry, Kailuan Mental Health Centre, Hebei province, Tangshan, China); Yang, Ling (School of Public Health, North China University of Science and Technology, Hebei province, Tangshan, China); Lv, Han (Department of Radiology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China); Yin, Zhiyu (Longzhen Senior Care, Beijing, China); Li, Hongyang (Department of Ophthalmology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China); Yang, Yingping (Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment and Health, and State Key Laboratory of Environmental Health (Incubating), School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China); Liu, Guangfeng (Department of Ophthalmology, Peking University International Hospital, Beijing, China); Li, Jing (Department of Radiology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China); Xie, Guotong (Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China); Wu, Shouling (Department of Cardiology, Kailuan General Hospital, 57 Xinhua E Rd, Tangshan, China); Wang, Zhenchang (Department of Radiology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China)","Li, Jing (Capital Medical University; Beijing Friendship Hospital); Xie, Guotong (Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China); Wu, Shouling (Kailuan General Hospital); Wang, Zhenchang (Capital Medical University; Beijing Friendship Hospital)","Li, Rui (Capital Medical University; Beijing Friendship Hospital); Hui, Ying (Capital Medical University; Beijing Friendship Hospital); Zhang, Xiaoyue (Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China); Zhang, Shun (Department of Psychiatry, Kailuan Mental Health Centre, Hebei province, Tangshan, China); Lv, Bin (Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China); Ni, Yuan (Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China); Li, Xiaoshuai (Capital Medical University; Beijing Friendship Hospital); Liang, Xiaoliang (Department of Psychiatry, Kailuan Mental Health Centre, Hebei province, Tangshan, China); Yang, Ling (North China University of Science and Technology); Lv, Han (Capital Medical University; Beijing Friendship Hospital); Yin, Zhiyu (Longzhen Senior Care, Beijing, China); Li, Hongyang (Capital Medical University; Beijing Friendship Hospital); Yang, Yingping (Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Liu, Guangfeng (Peking University International Hospital); Li, Jing (Capital Medical University; Beijing Friendship Hospital); Xie, Guotong (Ping An Healthcare Technology, Beijing, China); Wu, Shouling (Kailuan General Hospital); Wang, Zhenchang (Capital Medical University; Beijing Friendship Hospital)",0,0,,,https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12877-023-04593-8,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167725806,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,

Here, we identified the cytomorphological effects of KYNA and SZR104 in secondary microglial cultures established from newborn rat forebrains. We quantitatively analyzed selected morphological aspects of microglia in control (unchallenged), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated (challenged), KYNA- or SZR104-treated, and LPS + KYNA or LPS + SZR104-treated cultures. Multicolor immunofluorescence labeling followed by morphometric analysis (area, perimeter, transformation index, lacunarity, density, span ratio, maximum span across the convex hull, hull circularity, hull area, hull perimeter, max/min radii, mean radius, diameter of bounding circle, fractal dimension, roughness, circularity) on binary (digital) silhouettes of the microglia revealed their morphological plasticity under experimental conditions. SZR104 and, to a lesser degree, KYNA inhibited proinflammatory phenotypic changes. For example, SZR104 treatment resulted in hypertrophied microglia characterized by a swollen cell body, enlarged perimeter, increased transformation index/decreased circularity, increased convex hull values (area, perimeter, mean radius, maximum span, diameter of the bounding circle and hull circularity), altered box-counting parameters (such as fractal dimension), and increased roughness/decreased density. Taken together, analysis of cytomorphological features could contribute to the characterization of the anti-inflammatory activity of SZR104 on cultured microglia.","This work was supported by a grant from the Ministry of National Resources (GINOP 2.3.2-15-2016-00030 and 2.3.2-15-2016-00034) through the European Union Cohesion Fund.

We numerically demonstrate that the strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis typically holds, at least for systems with α≥0.6, which include Coulomb, monopole-dipole, and dipole-dipole interactions. Compared with short-range interacting systems, the eigenstate expectation value of a generic local observable is shown to deviate significantly from its microcanonical ensemble average for long-range interacting systems.

Taking the remolded loess (RL) and BML with 15% in mass of bentonite as research objects, the W–D cycles test, scanning electron microscope test and direct shear test were carried out to analyze the effects of W–D cycles on the microstructure and shear strength of samples. The regression equations between strength and micro-pore structure parameters were established by the multivariate linear stepwise regression method. The damage mechanism of BML after W–D cycles was studied by establishing damage degree models based on pore area ratio and cohesion. Results indicate that the water absorption and expansion of bentonite effectively block the intergranular pores, resulting in more medium and small pores and more pronounced surface contact of particles. After W–D cycles, the particle arrangement of samples before and after bentonite modification tends to be loose. Both the pore area ratio and fractal dimension increase and tend to stabilize after five cycles. The BML exhibits lower pore area ratio and greater fractal dimension while its cohesion and internal friction angle show more significant decrease after W–D cycles than those of RL. The damage variables based on pore area ratio and cohesion well describe the W–D induced damage of loess before and after modification from macro- and micro-scale perspectives. The damage degree of samples increases with W–D cycles, but the increment decreases.","The research presented in this paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51878551, 51478385).

In this paper, four dewatering protocols were developed to further explore the coupling mechanism of sludge dewatering through mechanical pressure, electric field and their joint. The results showed that the dewatering performance of the four dewatering protocols were as follows: pressurized electro-dewatering with constant voltage gradient mode (G-PEDW) > first mechanical dewatering then electro-dewatering > mechanical dewatering > electro-dewatering. The coupling mechanism was revealed from the perspectives of pore structure and moisture distribution of sludge cakes. The pore structure was discussed in detail from the whole pore size distribution and fractal dimension. The fractal dimension could quantitatively describe the change of pore structure. The moisture distribution was analyzed by the thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry test. The results showed that the electric field could reduce bound strength of moisture and produce new micro-pores to build more water flow paths, the water was discharged through interior capillary channels, and mechanical pressure could accelerate the water removing process. Response surface method was used to establish an empirical prediction model of G-PEDW, and discussed the selection of optimal parameters. The R-square values of mathematical models of moisture content and energy consumption were as high as 0.9863 and 0.9838, respectively, which was more advanced than other mathematical models.

The surface fractal dimensions are given by ds = 3 - H, corresponding to ds ≃ 2.23, 2.25, and 2.17, respectively. We present a simple method to obtain the surface area from the AFM images stored in a matrix of 512 × 512 pixels. We show that the considerable increase found in the surface areas of the treated samples w.r.t. to the non-treated ones (43% for PP, 85% for PTFE, and 25% for PCL, with errors of about 2.5% on samples of 2 µm × 2 µm) is consistent with the observed increase in the length scales of the fractal regime to determine H, typically by a factor of about 2, extending from a few to hundreds of nanometres. We stipulate that the intrinsic roughness already present in the original non-treated material surfaces may serve as 'fractal' seeds undergoing significant height fluctuations during plasma treatment, suggesting a pathway for the future development of advanced material interfaces with large surface areas at the nanoscale.","The authors are indebted to Alessandro Mietner for his technical support in the development of the plasma devices.

METHODS: Associations of retinal vascular measures with cognitive function and MRI biomarkers were examined amongst Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants in North Carolina who had gradable retinal photographs at Exams 2 (2002 to 2004, n = 313) and 5 (2010 to 2012, n = 306), and detailed cognitive testing and MRI at Exam 6 (2016 to 2018).
RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates and multiple comparisons, greater arteriolar fractal dimension (FD) at Exam 2 was associated with less isotropic free water of gray matter regions (β = -0.0005, SE = 0.0024, p = 0.01) at Exam 6, while greater arteriolar FD at Exam 5 was associated with greater gray matter cortical volume (in mm3 , β = 5458, SE = 20.17, p = 0.04) at Exam 6.
CONCLUSION: Greater arteriolar FD, reflecting greater complexity of the branching pattern of the retinal arteries, is associated with MRI biomarkers indicative of less neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors gratefully thank Jordan E.

Historically, it was utilised in the diagnosis and clinical management of corneal epithelial and stromal disorders. However, over the past 20 years, CCM has been increasingly used to image sub-basal small nerve fibres in a variety of peripheral neuropathies and central neurodegenerative diseases. CCM has been used to identify subclinical nerve damage and to predict the development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). The complex structure of the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus can be readily analysed through nerve segmentation with manual or automated quantification of parameters such as corneal nerve fibre length (CNFL), nerve fibre density (CNFD), and nerve branch density (CNBD). Large quantities of 2D corneal nerve images lend themselves to the application of artificial intelligence (AI)-based deep learning algorithms (DLA). Indeed, DLA have demonstrated performance comparable to manual but superior to automated quantification of corneal nerve morphology. Recently, our end-to-end classification with a 3 class AI model demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating healthy volunteers from people with and without peripheral neuropathy. We believe there is significant scope and need to apply AI to help differentiate between peripheral neuropathies and also central neurodegenerative disorders. AI has significant potential to enhance the diagnostic and prognostic utility of CCM in the management of both peripheral and central neurodegenerative diseases.",,This review received no external funding.,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,Christopher Nimsky,,2022-10-20,2022,2022-10-20,,11,20,6199,,,"Alam, Uazman; Anson, Matthew; Meng, Yanda; Preston, Frank; Kirthi, Varo; Jackson, Timothy L; Nderitu, Paul; Cuthbertson, Daniel J; Malik, Rayaz A; Zheng, Yalin; Petropoulos, Ioannis N","Alam, Uazman (Department of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Medicine, Institute of Life Course and Medical Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, UK.; Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Gastroenterology, Institute of Human Development, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.); Anson, Matthew (Department of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Medicine, Institute of Life Course and Medical Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, UK.); Meng, Yanda (Department of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Medicine, Institute of Life Course and Medical Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, UK.); Preston, Frank (Department of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Medicine, Institute of Life Course and Medical Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, UK.); Kirthi, Varo (King's Ophthalmology Research Unit, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London SE5 8AB, UK.); Jackson, Timothy L (King's Ophthalmology Research Unit, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London SE5 8AB, UK.); Nderitu, Paul (King's Ophthalmology Research Unit, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London SE5 8AB, UK.); Cuthbertson, Daniel J (Department of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Medicine, Institute of Life Course and Medical Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, UK.); Malik, Rayaz A (Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha P.O.

(2) Are there significant EEG differences comparing individuals with high and low levels of SPS?
METHODS: One hundred fifteen participants were measured with 64-channel EEG during a task-free resting state. The data were analyzed using criticality theory tools (detrended fluctuation analysis, neuronal avalanche analysis) and complexity measures (sample entropy, Higuchi's fractal dimension). Correlations with the 'Highly Sensitive Person Scale' (HSPS-G) scores were determined. Then, the cohort's lowest and the highest 30% were contrasted as opposites. EEG features were compared between the two groups by applying a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
RESULTS: During resting with eyes open, HSPS-G scores correlated significantly positively with the sample entropy and Higuchi's fractal dimension (Spearman's ρ = 0.22, p < 0.05). The highly sensitive group revealed higher sample entropy values (1.83 ± 0.10 vs. 1.77 ± 0.13, p = 0.031). The increased sample entropy in the highly sensitive group was most pronounced in the central, temporal, and parietal regions.
CONCLUSION: For the first time, neurophysiological complexity features associated with SPS during a task-free resting state were demonstrated. Evidence is provided that neural processes differ between low- and highly-sensitive persons, whereby the latter displayed increased neural entropy. The findings support the central theoretical assumption of enhanced information processing and could be important for developing biomarkers for clinical diagnostics.",,This research received no external funding.,Entropy,,Alexander N.

Here, in contrast, we examine the perceptual aspect of creativity by asking whether creative individuals are more likely to perceive recognizable forms in ambiguous stimuli -a phenomenon known as pareidolia. To this end, we designed a visual task in which participants were asked to identify as many recognizable forms as possible in cloud-like fractal images. We found that pareidolic perceptions arise more often and more rapidly in highly creative individuals. Furthermore, high-creatives report pareidolia across a broader range of image contrasts and fractal dimensions than do low creatives. These results extend the established body of work on DT by introducing divergent perception as a complementary manifestation of the creative mind, thus clarifying the perception-creation link while opening new paths for studying creative behavior in humans.","A.B. is supported by a Fonds de Recherche du Québec-Société et Culture doctoral grant (274043).

Analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal helps to diagnose and classify alcoholic and normal EEG signal.
Methods: One-second EEG signal was applied to classify alcoholic and normal EEG signal. To determine discriminative feature and EEG channel between the alcoholic and normal EEG signal, different frequency and non-frequency features of EEG signal, including power of EEG signal, permutation entropy (PE), approximate entropy (ApEn), katz fractal dimension (katz FD) and Petrosion fractal dimension (Petrosion FD) were extracted from alcoholic and normal EEG signal. Statistical analysis and Davis-Bouldin criterion (DB) were utilized to specify and select most discriminative feature and EEG channel between the alcoholic and normal EEG signal.
Results: Results of statistical analysis and DB criterion showed that the Katz FD in FP2 channel showed the best discrimination between the alcoholic and normal EEG signal. The Katz FD in FP2 channel showed the accuracies of 98.77% and 98.5% by two classifiers with 10-fold cross validation.
Conclusion: This method helps to diagnose alcoholic and normal EEG signal with the minimum number of feature and channel, which provides low computational complexity.

The FCGR allows representation of the frequencies of occurrence of k-mers (oligonucleotides of length k) in the form of images. The numerically encoded data are then used in a SAS analysis to enhance hidden features in DNA sequences. It is shown that the simulated SAS intensity allows us to obtain the fractal dimensions and scaling factors at various scales. These structural parameters can be used to distinguish unambiguously between the scaling properties of complex hierarchical DNA sequences. The validity of this approach is illustrated on several sequences from: Escherichia coli, Mouse mitochondrion, Homo sapiens mitochondrion and Human cosmid.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,,,"Algorithms; Animals; Cosmids; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Mitochondrial; Escherichia coli; Fractals; Humans; Mice; Mitochondria; Nonlinear Dynamics; Scattering, Small Angle; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Time Factors",2022-02-06,2022,2022-02-06,,23,3,1847,,,"Anitas, Eugen Mircea","Anitas, Eugen Mircea (Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, 141980 Dubna, Russia;, anitas@theor.jinr.ru; Horia Hulubei, National Institute of Physics and Nuclear Engineering, 077125 Bucharest, Romania)",,"Anitas, Eugen Mircea (Joint Institute for Nuclear Research; Horia Hulubei National Institute for R and D in Physics and Nuclear Engineering)",10,10,1.01,4.2,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/3/1847/pdf?version=1644376472,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145327546,31 Biological Sciences; 3102 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,

Polymers that can be molten are needed to obtain extruded filaments for Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), one of the most frequently employed techniques for 3D printing. The aim of this work was to evaluate the extrusion process and the physical appearance of filaments made of a hydrophilic polymer and a non-molten model drug. Metformin was used as model drug and Affinisol™ 15LV as the main carrier. Drug-loaded filaments were obtained by using a single-screw extruder and, subsequently, their printability was tested. Blends containing up to a 60% and 50% drug load with 5% and 7.5% of auxiliary excipients, respectively, were successfully extruded. Between the obtained filaments, those containing up to 50% of the drug were suitable for use in FDM 3D printing. The studied parameters, including residence time, flow speed, brittleness, and fractal dimension, reflect a critical point in the extrusion process at between 30-40% drug load. This finding could be essential for understanding the behaviour of filaments containing a non-molten component.",This work has been supported by an F.P.U. grant from the Spanish Government.,"This research was funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades of Spain (Project RTI2018-095041-B-C31) and by the Junta de Andalucía, Consejería de Economía, Conocimiento, Empresas y Universidad (Project US-1380923).",Pharmaceutics,,,,2022-04-15,2022,2022-04-15,,14,4,871,,,"Mora-Castaño, Gloria; Millán-Jiménez, Mónica; Linares, Vicente; Caraballo, Isidoro","Mora-Castaño, Gloria (Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidad de Sevilla, 41012 Seville, Spain.); Millán-Jiménez, Mónica (Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidad de Sevilla, 41012 Seville, Spain.); Linares, Vicente (Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidad de Sevilla, 41012 Seville, Spain.); Caraballo, Isidoro (Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidad de Sevilla, 41012 Seville, Spain.)","Caraballo, Isidoro (University of Seville)","Mora-Castaño, Gloria (University of Seville); Millán-Jiménez, Mónica (University of Seville); Linares, Vicente (University of Seville); Caraballo, Isidoro (University of Seville)",17,17,3.36,8.26,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/4/871/pdf?version=1650273409,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147228558,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,
